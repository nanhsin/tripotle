Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
[Pre-Chorus: Alabama]
I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be, that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle
[Chorus: Alabama & (*NSYNC*)]
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(A little more time) I'm sure we do
(Yes he did, baby)
[Verse 2: Alabama]
In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world"
2000,1,Breathe,Faith Hill,https://genius.com/Faith-hill-breathe-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face, and I've
Never been this swept away
[Verse 2]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart
[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
And baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe
[Verse 3]
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now"
2000,2,Smooth,Santana featuring Rob Thomas,https://genius.com/Klezmergord-song-13-lyrics,"I could sell all my organs to the Chinese black market and it would not even make a difference to you
And you said I was so sweet
I gave you Type-2 Diabetes
But you're so salty I've got heart disease now
I suppose, I'm a fucking ghost
I suppose I'm a motherfucking ghost to you
I'm not doing this for my health
I might as well kill myself
And at my funeral I want Santana featuring Rob Thomas to play ""Smooth"" as my body's lowered into the flames"

Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return
[Chorus 1]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why
[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say"

If no one is around you, say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Why the sudden change?

If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me ""baby""
Better say my name
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Any other day I would call, you would say
""Baby, how's your day?"" But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh-huh, yeah, okay""
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?"

Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question

And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces (I'm searching for)
I think I found my way home"

I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you

I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do

The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark

You touch every place in my heart"

And if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk
And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around, I'll smile again
[Pre-Chorus]
Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together
Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot"

So, why do you act like I still care about him? (Care about him)
Lookin' at me like I'm hurt

Don't you forget I had him first

2000,11,Higher,Creed,https://genius.com/Creed-higher-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When dreaming, I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""
[Chorus]
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate"

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow

Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

2000,32,Hot Boyz,"Missy Elliott featuring Nas, Eve and Q-Tip",https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Completed my whole life

There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright

Y'all bitches can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix your hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for bonapalies, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward, girl, you need a real nigga
Off top knick-a-boxers hurting shit
Bend over ho; show me what you workin with!"

Now, let me welcome everybody to the 
wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug through your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass <>hemp be
A place where you never find a dance floor 
empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines 
servin' fiends
I been in the game for 30 years makin' rap tunes (
Say what?
)
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '22, they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', 
lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city gettin' pay

Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Look, homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up

Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)

Where pretty, uh, uh, is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearing on my record
Tell 'em I'm a gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I—
Won't you please believe when I—

We been hurt, down before
Ah, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

One opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
would you capture it?
Or just let it slip?
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he
won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he
Knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's
dope, he knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better- (Lose yourself, lose yourself, lose yourself)
Los Angeles, make some noise!
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

On the merry-go-round that we call life

Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

Feelin' so safe and sound
Somethin' else knocks me down

You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is

One fine day you wake up
Completely, hopelessly fallin' in love
He's just what you're lookin' for

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he
won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he
Knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's
dope, he knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better- (Lose yourself, lose yourself, lose yourself)

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore
Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life
His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane
When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel"

Some time to be alone

You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so

But you overlooked me somehow
Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

When I took off to Tennessee, I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far

Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

2000,95,Cowboy Take Me Away,Dixie Chicks,https://genius.com/The-chicks-cowboy-take-me-away-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I said, ""I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars""
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said
[Chorus]
""Cowboy, take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can, into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to Heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you""
[Verse 2]
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your 
simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me"

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
[Verse 1]
When we hooked up
We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?"

Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own car note and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

Farrah

The shoes on my feet (
I bought 'em

The clothes I'm wearing (
I bought 'em

The rock I'm rocking (
I bought it

'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing (
I bought it

The house I live in (
I bought it

The car I'm driving (

Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
There was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now
[Chorus]
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I (If I) didn't tell you this tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I wanna get it on

After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you belong"

Oh, yeah

Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on"

In the corners of my mind, I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe that I can break free
'Cause you see, I have been
Down for so long, feel like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance
[Chorus: Mary Mary]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (So I can dance)
I just wanna praise You (Just wanna praise You)
I just wanna praise You (Just wanna praise You)
You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)

I'm gonna praise You"

Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move

Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto

Just hanging by a moment here with you"

You seem uneasy, want to approach me, throw me a line
But then somethin' inside you grabs you, says, ""Who am I?""
I know exactly 'cause it happens with all the guys
[Pre-Chorus]
So you, so what'cha gonna do?
Come on and talk to me
Promise you, won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me

Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey-hey
Since the return of her stay on the Moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey-hey
Hey-hey, yeah
[Chorus]
But tell me, did you sail across the Sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
 
to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
[Verse 2]
Now, that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracin' her way through the constellation, hey-hey (Mmm)
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey-hey, yeah
Now, that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly, so he never did land"

I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leavin'
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared, I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'
[Chorus]
If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathin' room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby, you need to come home, come home
There's a little bit of somethin' me
In everything in you"

Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic

Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Got out of bed at all

It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Is having the best day of my life"

And if that day comes

For better worse, wherever

Until you cried, never

2001,24,Lady Marmalade,"Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mýa and Pink",https://genius.com/Country-genius-songs-of-the-south-louisiana-annotated,"The music of Louisiana is one of the most varied in this collection of Songs of the South, and consists of Country, Creole, Zydeco, Cajun, New Orleans Jazz, New Orleans Blues, Swamp Rock and Swamp Blues.  We're going to roam pretty far afield from country music, but stay with me on this; it's an amazing range of music to find packed into just one state. As they say in New Orleans, ""En ce qui concerne les gens , la nourriture et la musique , la variété est le piment de la vie."" (When it comes to people, food and music, variety is the spice of life."") So ""laissez le bon ton roulet"". (Let the good times roll.)
Songs About Louisiana
One of the oldest songs about the state is 
""Lakes of Pontchartrain""
, a folk song from around the time of the War of 1812. Not nearly so old, but a song that tells a story from Louisiana's early statehood is Johnny Horton's 
""Battle of New Orleans""
. Perhaps the most famous song associated with the state is by two-time Governor of Louisiana, Jimmie Davis, who wrote and recorded 
""You Are My Sunshine""
, one of the official state songs
.
Other famous songs about the state include Randy Newman's 
""Louisiana 1927""
, Leon Russell's 
""Jambalaya (on the Bayou)""
, although old-timers prefer the 
Hank Williams Sr. version
, Hank Williams Jr's 
""Cajun Baby""
, Mel McDaniel's 
""Louisiana Saturday Night""
, and Doug Kershaw's 
""Calling Baton Rouge""
.
Some of the most famous rock songs about Louisiana are from Creedence Clearwater Revival. While the band isn't from Louisiana, they sure sounded like it. Two that fit this collection are 
""Proud Mary""
 and 
""Born on the Bayou""
. The Animals' version of the traditional folk song, 
""House of the Rising Sun""
 is certainly well known. Lucinda Williams' 
""Cresent City""
 and Sonny Landreth's 
""Back to Bayaou Teche""
 may be less well known, but are equally good, as is this  version of 
""Lady Marmalada""
 by Christina Auguilera, Pink, Lil' Kim and Mya
.
Songs About New Orleans
Starting with songs that celebrate Mardi Gras, Dr. John's 
""Goin' Back to New Orleans""
, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band's  
""Tootie Ma""
, a brass band version of Jelly Roll Morton's 
""New Orleans Blues""
, Fats Domino's 
""The Fat Man""
 and Louis Armstrong's 
""When the Saints Go Marching In""
 will give you a taste of what New Orleans jazz is all about. But the list gets even more eclectic. Fats Domino does it in R&B with 
""Walkin' to New Orleans""
, and Them does it in blues with the Big Joe Williams' song, 
""Baby, Please Don't Go""
. Finally, Sonny Landreth sums-up the spirit of New Orleans with 
""Levee Town""
.
Hurricane Katrina and it's aftermath exposed the terrible response of FEMA and the true politics of the Bush Administration. Those attitudes get skewered in Bruce Springsteen's cover of 
""How Can a Poor Man Stand such Times and Live?""
, Bob Dylan's variation on the Memphis Minnie song 
""The Levee's Gonna Break""
 and Steve Earle's 
""This City""
.
Country Music
Country Music in Louisiana is heavily influenced by Cajun and blues music. It's played on the fiddle, guitar and other string instruments, and like it's influencers, It's bold and expressive.  Representative of the Louisiana Country sound is Lucinda Williams' 
""Louisiana Man""
, Jerry Reed's 
""Amos Moses""
, Sammy Kershaw's 
""Third Rate Romance""
, George Strait's 
""Adalida""
, Mary Chapin Carpenter's 
""Down at the Twist and Shout""
, and Black Water Bride's 
""Over You""
.
Creole Music
The Creole fiddle arrived in South Louisiana in the 17th century, coming ashore with French-speaking Africans from Saint-Domingue. The performance of Creole fiddle takes a lot of its cues from the African banjo.  The 1950s brought Zydeco to the forefront, with its big accordion sound, eclipsing Creole music. But Creole lives on in the homes and small clubs of Louisiana, and some argue it's a better representation of its original than present day Zydeco. Some great Creole music can be heard in
Cedric Watson's 
""La Vieille Chanson De Mardi Gras""
 and in the legendary Canray Fontenot's 
""Les Barres De La Prison""
.
Zydeco Music
Zydeco developed in southwest Louisiana by French Creole speakers, and blends blues with R&B. Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers were the first to have their music recorded in 1929 with 
""It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo""
.  Zydeco is sometimes described as polka music, but that's really just the accordion. If you listen closely, what you'll hear is the blues. Performances rely on the back beat, with modern bands adding a double-kick bass drum to emphasize the syncopation. The accordion almost always plays some blues licks, and the guitars echo that. Listen to Boozoo Chavis hit a groove with 
""Uncle Bud""
, and Clifton Chenier sing 
""Tu Le Ton Son Ton""
 and  
""Ay Tete Fee""
.
Cajun Music
Cajun music is one of the oldest forms of music in Louisiana. The French people who settled in Acadia, Nova Scotia, brought with them the music rooted in medieval France.  After their expulsion by the British in 1755, many of them migrated to southern Louisiana. There, these ""Acadians"" encountered and intermarried with other ethnic groups, fostering their evolution into ""the Cajuns"".  By the late 19th century, they adopted the accordion into their music. While it fell out of favor for a while in in the first half of the 20th century, it came back in 1964 when Dewey Balfa performed at the Newport Folk festival. Cajun music has enjoyed growing popularity since then, and is represented by Doug Kersahaw, with 
""Louisiana Man""
, Dewey Balfa with 
""Jai Ete Au Bal""
, and the Lost Bayou Ramblers with 
""Blue Moon Special""
. But no discussion of Cajun would fail to mention 
""Jole Blon""
. It's practically the Cajun national anthem. The version here is by Waylon Jennings
.
New Orleans Jazz
New Orleans Jazz is itself an amalgamation of styles that come from a long musical tradition in New Orleans. You'll find an excellent presentation of it's history 
right here
. For now, give a listen to Louis Armstrong playing 
""Sweet Georgia Brown""
, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band perform a version of  
""Tailgate Ramble""
, John Boutte sing 
""Foot of Canal Street""
,  and Nina Simone sing 
""Little Liza Jane""
.
New Orleans Blues
One of the oldest is the traditional 
""St. James Infirmary Blues""
, but the New Orleans blues style didn't really get started until after WW2.  It's influenced by New Orleans jazz and Caribbean music, and it's generally upbeat with a faster tempo than swamp blues. You'll find examples in Professor Longhair's 
""Walk Your Blues Away""
, Johnny Copeland's 
""Devil's Hand""
 and Dr. John's 
""I'm Gonna Go Fishing""
.
Swamp Blues
Evolving from the delta blues, swamp blues developed first in  Baton Rouge during the 1950s. It uses a slower tempo and is influenced by cajun music. It's recognizable in songs like
Creedence Clearwater Revival's 
""Suzie Q""
, Tina Turner's 
""Bayou Song""
, Lazy Lester's 
""I'm a Man""
, Lucinda Williams' 
""Can't Let Go""
 and Tony Joe White's 
""Polk Salad Annie""
.
Swamp Rock
Some people claim that swamp rock begins and ends with CCR, but you'll find examples in The Meters' 
""Fire on the Bayou""
, Little Feat's 
""Hamburger Midnight""
, as well as CCR's 
""Run Through the Jungle""
.
Louisiana Artists
Here's a list of artists native to the state and those who spent enough time in the state to claim it as their home.  It's long, but it's far from comprehensive. Think of this as a primer. You can find the complete list of members of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame 
right here
. The list includes one - three songs for each artist to give you a sense of their music

Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah"

Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control
[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah"

Instinctively I know what you're thinking (What you're thinking)

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby

I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You were standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""

Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion
And I can't get enough
[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery
Why I surrender

My momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

And when I fall flat on my face

Should my tender heart be broken

Fendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright)
The rise of Diddy and City, with one or two throws
I'm draftin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows? I know and I love it when you make your knees
Touch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo'
And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, ""Gimme Some Mo'""
You say you like that, when 
I hit it from behind and I'll be
Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, ""Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?""
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this

He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can’t that be me?""
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says
[Chorus]
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
Now and dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream

With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah"

I never cared too much for love

Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

But I'm not every girl, and I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty got a job, shorty got a car

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

[Part]
Keiner lacht mehr, Mama, ich war beim Notar, Mama
GmbH, Mama, ich glaub', ich brauch' 'ne Havanna
Zwei Jahre lang kein Lebenszeichen
Ich hab' gewartet wie ein kleines Kind am Zebrastreifen
Weil ich dacht', so Business-Sachen sind wie Wissenschaften
Bis ich verstanden hab': Ich muss nur ein paar Schritte machen
Und endlich alle andern sich nach mir richten lassen
Von nun an nur noch Bling-Bling und Cristal-Flaschen
Doch bevor wir so weit sind, sammeln Gerichte Akten
Bullen stürmen die Hotelsuite, um mich zu fassen
Ich tausche ein paar Bitches gegen ein paar Mitinsassen
Yeah, ich schätze, sowas nennt man „Licht und Schatten“
Nach nur acht Stunden wieder frei, danke Gott!
Doch das Ganze hat Haken wie ein Angel-Shop
Andre Leute gehen Sonntag früh zum Gottesdienst
Bei mir steh'n Fotografen vor dem Haus, ich seh' das objektiv
Als die beiden mit dem Streit in jeder Zeitung sind
Kämpfen sie ums Recht auf Shindy, als wär' ich ein Scheidungskind
Jeder will den Krieg gewinn'n, ich wurd' zum Matchball
Ab da wusst' ich, dieses Spielchen wird zum Rechtsfall
Ich sag': „Ich will raus“, aber man lässt mich nicht
Ich sag': „Ich zahl' euch aus“, aber man lässt mich nicht
Plötzlich reichen die Probleme bis nach Bietigheim
Bis vor die Haustür, ich muss nicht weiter ausführ'n
Cops woll'n ein Statement, BILD will ein Statement
Doch ich red' lieber mit 'ner MILF über Spray-Tan
Fick aufs Spotlight, Accounts offline
Kein Output, dafür Bauschutt
Stell' ein Studio hin, wo ich das erste Mal gekifft hab'
Vier Leute teilen eine Zwei-Liter-Schwip-Schwap
Damit zuhause keiner etwas riecht, essen wir Tic Tac
Jetzt sitz' ich hier auf Samtsofas und so Schnickschnack
Persische Teppiche, Überwachungsmonitor wie Scarface
Noch immer Hotels und Heartbreaks
Labels renn'n mir hinterher, ich kann alles haben
Ob ich Millionär bin, musst du Alex fragen
Ich bleib' ein Kind, er macht das Business mit sein'n Assistenten
Hasse nicht Erwachsensein, hass' nur, wie Erwachsne denken
Alles, was ich will, ist 100k im Monat Taschengeld
Eine Patek, einen Phantom und 'ne Mademoiselle
Manchmal schmeckt das Leben wie ein Obstragout
Manchmal kriegt jeder, der dir helfen will, 'nen Drohanruf
Manchmal wird die Rolex von dei'm Vater aus dei'm Haus geklaut
Und manchmal willst du gar nicht wissen, wer es war
Ich kann das niemals meiner Mutter erzähl'n
Oder dass zehntausend Euro aus der Schublade fehl'n, yeah
Das ist das Gefühl, wenn du nicht weißt, wem du vertrau'n kannst
Ich wünscht', wir wär'n wie damals jetzt, mit Alkopops vor Kaufland
ID auf den brandneuen Nikes
Ich bin Ice-T, wie die Zeit fliegt
Vor sechs Jahr'n exmatrikuliert
Doch in sechs Jahr'n mehr gelernt, als hätt' ich sechs Jahre studiert, yeah
Ich hab' dich letztens noch geseh'n in deiner scheiß Karre
An der Kreuzung bei McDonald's, Polizeiwache
Du dachtest damals, du wirst NBA-Pro
Guck auf die Day-Date, Bro, den Rolls-Royce Wraith, Bro
Wer ballt jetzt, Junge? Ich hol' den Rebound
Seh' fresher aus als damals mein Profilbild bei GreekTown
Du sahst aus, als würd' dich dein Beamtenalltag reizen
Danke für die beste rote Ampel aller Zeiten
Ich weiß noch früher, große Pause, Raucherstein
Alles, was ich wollte, war da stehen und genauso sein
Carhartt Beanies, Osiris D3s
Weiße Dickies-Sweater, Riot-City-Rapper
Jetzt ist euer Leben nur noch Zweitliga, ah
Jeden Tag nine-to-five Minesweeper, ah
Damals hieß es, „Open-Mic, nur Shindy kann nicht rein!“
Heute heißt es, „Ey, du bist doch Shindy, kann das sein?“
Ich scheiß' auf eure Riot-City-Jams
Ich bin immer noch Bissingens 50 Cent
Ich steh' morgens dann auf, wenn ich will
Und piss' auf meine alte Schule von mei'm Haus in den Hills, eh
Ich lach' jetzt, Mama, haha, Mama
Die schaufeln mir kein Grab, die bau'n mir eine Grabkammer
Papa meinte, er ist stolz, in meinem Traum neulich
Wir hab'n nicht viel gemeinsam, aber ich war lange blauäugig
Ich dachte, so Intrigen gibt's nur in 'ner Daily-Soap
Oder irgendwelchen Serien von HBO
Alle selbstsüchtig, auf die harte Art gelernt
Dass es keine Freunde gibt, sobald das Geld mitmischt
Paradox, dass wir das Label „Friends with Money“ nenn'n
Was soll ich sagen? Der holt 'n Rolls-Royce Cullinan
Das war ein Dilemma, so wie Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland
Eh, doch ich bin back für meinen Magic-Moment
Den ganzen Tag im Studio wie ein Vocalcoach
Das ist kein Comeback, ich nenn' das Road to GOAT
Geh und richt es deinen Freunden aus, schöne Grüße
Keine Pilotenbrille, doch es folgen Höhenflüge
Nur paar Dinge, die rausmussten
Drip – Vorsicht, nicht ausrutschen, ah!"

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you"

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, 
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

But in the end, it doesn't even matter

2002,8,What's Luv?,Fat Joe featuring Ashanti,https://genius.com/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-whats-luv-by-fat-joe-feat-ashanti-lyrics,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's talk about Fat Joe…
 
technically for the first time, since, ""Lean Back"" was by Terror Squad
, even though he just happened to be rapping on about 77% of it. Now, I want to correct a little mistake I made in that episode, because I had said that it was Big Pun who was the leader of the Terror Squad and that 
when he died
, the head of the group changed over to Fat Joe, but in actuality, it was Fat Joe that founded Terror Squad, and then Big Pun joined them later. Which is weird to me, because, I mean, Big Pun is, like, Mr:
""Rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity filling""
I mean, he always came off as the guy in charge, and Fat Joe, *sample lyric from Twins* I mean, he's not bad, I don't want you to think that he sucks, but… he's… when your standing next to:
""A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support""
You're gonna look like second in command, whoever you are. And in addition, it was kinda Big Pun who became more popular than him in such a short amount of time, with hits like 
""Still Not a Player""
 charting around 98, and Fat Joe not really having a big hit until 2002 with this song ""What's Luv"", and guess what? 
Both of them were ""Thugs Need Love Too"", songs.
 Although like I've always said, you can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting, and with Pun, he had the asshole rap personality down pat. You see, the man was so brash and upfront with his delivery, it was kind of endearing:
""Bet Ya Man Can't do it like this
He can't work the middle, cause his thang too little""
""I don't wanna be a player no more
(I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot)""
And that's what made him likable: the over-the-topness of his lyricism made him enjoyable to listen to, as well as having outstanding rhyming abilities, and in addition, Pun was just more fun. I mean, for a guy who looked like this… he knew that he had to do something to compensate for his appearance, and so when making a love… okay, it's just a sex song, there's nothing lovey dove about this:
""I rip my prick through ya hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers""
But, when making this kind of song, he always came off as a guy who did not take himself too seriously
""Litte brown hairs everywhere"""

But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on 
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy

I can save you
I can take you away from here

Ten million ways to love somebody

Baby du bist alles, was ich will
Wenn du hier in meinen Armen liegst
Ich kann es kaum glauben
Wir sind im Himmel
Oh, ich denke an all unsere frühen Jahre
Es gab nur dich und mich
Wir waren jung und wild und frei
Jetzt kann dich nichts mehr von mir trennen
Wir hatten diesen Weg vor uns
Aber das ist jetzt vorbei
Du hälst mich, komme nochmal wieder
Baby du bist alles, was ich will
Wenn du hier in meinen Armen liegst
Ich kann es kaum glauben
Wir sind im Himmel
Und Liebe ist alles, was ich brauche
Und ich fand sie in deinem Herzen
Es ist nicht allzu schwer zu erkennen
Wir sind im Himmel
Nun, nichts konnte ändern, was du mir bedeutest
Es gibt viel, dass ich sagen könnte
Aber halte mich jetzt
Denn deine Liebe leuchtet uns den Weg
Baby du bist alles, was ich will
Wenn du hier in meinen Armen liegst
Ich kann es kaum glauben
Wir sind im Himmel
Und Liebe ist alles, was ich brauche
Und ich fand sie in deinem Herzen
Es ist nicht allzu schwer zu erkennen
Wir sind im Himmel
Unsere Träume werden jetzt wahr
Durch die guten und die schlechten Zeiten
Ich werde bei dir sein

And the drama queens

Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, 
grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers

And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies"

But she's bein' a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here

Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help"

2002,56,Can't Fight the Moonlight,LeAnn Rimes,https://genius.com/Leann-rimes-cant-fight-the-moonlight-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Under a lover's sky, gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall, well, just wait until
'Til the sun goes down
[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feelin', so right
It'll steal your heart tonight
[Chorus]
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart
[Verse 2]
There's no escapin' love once a gentle breeze (Once a gentle breeze)
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think, it won't be too long (Not too long)

Here's how it goes
You and me, up and down
But maybe this time we'll get it right, worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks 
(When it breaks)
All it takes is some trying
[Chorus]
If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So, if you go
You should know (

It's hard to just forget the past so fast
It was good (

Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better"

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight

Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, ""What'll it be?""

He didn't pour me a beer

Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate

And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"""

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash 
off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal"

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right

Feel broken down, ah

I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
[Verse 2]
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran

Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love"

2003,5,When I'm Gone,3 Doors Down,https://genius.com/3-doors-down-when-im-gone-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind
[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
[Verse 2]
When your education X-ray cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness, I'm alive, but I'm alone
And part of me is fighting this, but part of me is gone"

Livin' my life like there's no hell
In the drawer there's a Bible at the hotel
I can see it's some kind of pre-planned place
Been fool enough to go play it risky
Wish I thought the Good Lord would miss me
Lord, I wonder what You meant by ""saved by grace""
I put Your scripture away, stopped tryin' to find the way
I can't look for truth while I'm lyin' -- that's the worst
I put Your scripture away, I know that crime don't pay
I can't look at truth now I'm cryin' -- yes, it hurts
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone goes through their slow spells
But your half-started Bible has something you just can't deny
It's been written for you for a long time
You just have to start it and keep tryin'
That ain't hard if you can read and write
I put the scriptures in place, I wrote the words within
I left the Book for you so you'd find it, and you did
Don't put My scriptures away -- I don't care where you've been
I said the Book is true, why not try it? Let me in!
I saw you just today with it open
It was the strangest thing how it happened
Since You called, God, my world's been startin' to change
(Since you called God, your world's been startin' to change)
I decided to read the Bible today
The quotes started jumpin' off the page
When they read it in church
I was often sleeping away
I've thought about you for a long time
It seems as if You read my mind
(It seems as if you read My mind)
That's because the Scriptures are livin', like they say
I finally picked up today
(I'm glad you picked up today)
God's Word and changed my ways
(My Word and changed your ways)
I just called Your name I want to come back home
(I just called your name I want you to come back home)
I just called Your name I want to come back home

2003,11,Get Low,Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz featuring Ying Yang Twins,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

2003,14,21 Questions,50 Cent featuring Nate Dogg,https://genius.com/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-21-questions-by-50-cent-feat-nate-dogg-lyrics,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic.
 Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the ""thugs need love too"" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his ""pop gangster"" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this ""pop rapper"" for what he felt that he was: ""a studio thug"" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with… *""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions""*… with club songs and love songs… Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing ""21 Questions"", the love song I wanted to look at today
When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""
50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity
And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?
*""Rider, Part 2""*
Oh yeah, yeah…
So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!
But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares
*intro*
Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?
*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*
*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money
*police arrive*"

You wonder how I done it
I'm about to tell you how
It took a lot of long lonely nights
Riding round
I got some good friends
Piled up in my truck
When you would knock me down
They were there to pick me up
You thought that I was weak
You tried to play me foolish
You tried to drag me down
But I just couldn't do it
I mashed the gas pedal
And flipped the brights on
Hit highway 41 and let the bygones be bygones
Try to get lost
'Cause I got nowhere to be
Gotta clear my mind and let the music set me free
[Chorus]
Oh, oh I learned it from the radio
Dashboard glow, banging on the console
Singin at the top of my lungs
Wakin this whole town up
Riding round all night, in circles
Chasing headlights down that old dirt road
If you wanna know how I let you go
I learned it from the radio
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism

In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

A RUSTLE of leaves. Disturbing. Urgent. SNAP INTO:
[Lush foliage beneath a darkening sky. A BALETE TREE shakes. Something climbing its way up. We’re INSIDE SOMEONE’S POV and CLIMBING fast. Leaves and vines and green rushing past.]
[More rustling and the CLIMBER EMERGES. But it’s no animal. Impossibly -- this is a MAN. His face obscured by a GREEN HOOD cut from a sail’s muslin. TATTERED CLOTHING over a taut frame. He wields a COMPOUND BOW. A QUIVER FULL OF ARROWS slung around his back.]
[From atop the tree, he looks out at the EXPANSE of BLACK SEA. And then he sees it... far off on the horizon...]
A FISHING TRAWLER
[The climber STRIKES AN ARROW like a MATCH -- quick and fluid -- FIRING the FLAMING BOLT so fast we barely saw him string the bow -- and we FLY WITH THE ARROW -- a straight shot down to the BEACH below. Striking a TARGET a hundred feet away.]
[A WALL OF FIRE IGNITES. Pre-planned. It’s a signal fire.]
MAN’S VOICE (V.O.): I’ve never seen anything like it.
EXT. FISHING TRAWLER - MAIN DECK - THAT MOMENT

2003,46,Damn!,YoungBloodZ featuring Lil Jon,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait when a moment can vanish so fast

Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?

She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, 
Lena Horne
, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else
And behind your dark glasses, you're
You're something else

Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad"

If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through

Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me

It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

My blessings aren't in front of me

Holding both of them

But after all that, I still loved You
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So, God

You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own

I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road
[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to Heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on Earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends of that red dirt road
[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road"

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was
[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking
[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?"

Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings"
2003,89,Sing for the Moment,Eminem,https://genius.com/Eminem-sing-for-the-moment-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, 
and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, 
brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & 
Eminem

(
Come on
) Sing with me (
Sing

Sing it

Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (
Come on

Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun,
 
lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)"

Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's 
just out
 lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
[Chorus]
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn (Yeah), let it burn (Ooh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through (Yeah)
Let it burn (Let it burn, woah), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn"

Mm-mm
Mm-mm, oh
Mm-mm
[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial
[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah"

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But uh-oh"
2004,5,The Way You Move,OutKast featuring Sleepy Brown,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear
[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you"

Can't get this out of my head

The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know
Oh, oh, baby

When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe

We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance"

Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all
, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the Rockaway

I could make you a celebrity overnight
[Verse 1: Twista]
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, 
got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight"

Someone else
It's one thing when you get addicted
But it's scary when it's who you look to for help
I swear your melody does alot for me and life goes on oh well
But why look for answers when you know yourself, do you know your self?
Do u know yourself?

Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin' diamonds by the pair
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin' is your hair, yea
I'm ridin' with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
A ladies man, but the boy smack thugs

Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady

They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me

Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' peoples CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my homies ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill 2Pac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that broad
Why?

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like

Lasse mich servieren von 'nem Sternekoch
Und am nächsten Tag steht dein Ex auf mit 'nem Pferdekopf
Cheers auf uns zwei, lass die Zeit laufen

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Da, da, da, da
Da da da
[Verse 1]
Oh, I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holdin' us down, on my own and no
[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you
[Chorus]
You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me (Me)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side (Side)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter
If you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten
You should've known better"

Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself
Going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and...
[Chorus]
On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you
[Verse]
Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive
'Cause...
[Chorus]
On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you"

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away
[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away"

Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh
[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""
[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright

I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh"

I went Rocky Mountain climbin'

And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

He said, ""I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then"

We made love and then you cried

Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, and there was hurt

Old ones died and the new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine

I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do

Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy

I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long

You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core
And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price

Oh, and I don't want to die for you

I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free"

I woke up early this morning around 4 a.m.​
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay
There's nothing left to say, but
[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me
[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been

I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor

Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time

A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore

Parody of ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West (Featuring Jamie Foxx)
(Romans 1:18-25, Job 40:15-41:34)
They make a monkey right out of me -- Yes, they've been tryin' endlessly
Overeager bonediggers -- they never found that jigsaw piece
They make a monkey right out of me -- It makes for funky biology
I'm not the kid of some hominid, who comes from a lizard, whose mama was a fish
Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I say evolution don't figure
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I ain't never seen no holes bigger
It sounds like no evidence found, it sounds like their heads in the ground
It sounds like they're just too proud, it sounds quite boneheaded
You need to ponder whether evolution is wrong
Whether maybe you was put on under cover of dawn
They said, ""We can tell from rocks, we tell by the carbon""
'Cause this world has gotta flock of descendants of Charles Robert Darwin
But I'm lookin' for the odds at casinos
That life could come to be from random acids amino
Zero -- we know it's hocus pocus
And they wanna make all of that an accidental process?
O.K., let's pretend a fishy got some kids
That stood up on their fins and crawled up on land
Without evidence and here we are today
If you're trustin' in this worldview you better have faith
You know why? They make too much of nothin'
Stuff that I've heard it should have been on Mythbusters
Their best forensic samples couldn't cut the mustard
You don't care what none of us say you still trust it
(They make a monkey) Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (right out of me)
But I say evolution don't figure (It makes for funky)
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (biology)
But I ain't never seen no holes bigger (I'm not the kid)
It sounds like no evidence found (of some hominid)
It sounds like their heads in the ground (who comes from a lizard)
It sounds like they're just too proud (whose mama was a fish)
It sounds quite boneheaded
1859's the fateful year -- they've had 150 years to prove their great new theory
I know some funny ways they found support for some of it, kids
They made some hominids from parts of gibbons and pigs
Your museums are deceiving when you visit one they
Take a couple bones pawn it off as a primate
They were s'posed to find all sorts of life forms we could study
They went to the rocks and got dinosaurs in the muddy
They're talkin' down actin' like the Bible is so funny
Could've got dinos sooner if they tried Job 41-y
If it ain't no bunk, holler ""We want proof now, we want proof now, yeah!""
It's somethin' that'll make you mad
Cause all the links they had were either weak or bad
Great big digs since the 1860's
And after waiting and searchin' they found out it doesn't exist?
CHORUS
Now I ain't hating on the bone digger, no, not me
I've found trilobites in stone and some petrified trees
You know evolution ain't paleontology
Transition forms are lackin' -- got a hole up his sleeve
But -- the other option's not fun
So he gonna make you into a man out of that pond scum
This is his religion baby, don't be surprised
That fishy on all fours on his jeep's his messiah
So, let's no fight -- I won't abuse Darwin 'cause that's not nice
And they're gonna keep stallin' and tryin' to prove they're right though
And when you catch on we'll lead you back to the Bible

Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes"

Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves is so erotic
I watch her, I'm like, ""Bounce that ass, girl""
I get it crump in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh

I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

(
I want a soldier
) The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' them Impalas around
(
I got a soldier
) With the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs, ridin' harder than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them flames spittin' at you, tell 'em, ""Don't even try it""
Shoot it with 'Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya gotta be G's, you way outta your league, please

We like them boys that be in them 'lacs leanin' (Leanin')
Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that wheel clean and (Clean and)
They always be talkin' that country slang we like
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin' (Beatin')
Eyes be so low from that chiefin' (Chiefin')
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me with street credibility
[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood, I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough and he better be street"

So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change

And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

I somehow find you and I collide

Seven years has gone so fast

Was he on ten toes gettin' to the bread?
Real money get inside beef with a bed
Any instro, straight up shred
Don't ask why your rapper close or man'll get fed
Talkin' tough when your just some beg
Violate, you will see your white kicks turn red
Do what I like, don't care what they said
That's fine, all I can team in is two legs
Straight shellin' when I touch booth for revenge
Got too much pain, head gone ment'
Still patterned up 'cause man got sensе
Flows for the ladies, bars for the gеnts
On a lil' heat for an opp boy, head straight, action, no talk, this intent
On smoke for my name, I don't need street cred
Buss on a teller with a baddie, no spread
Talkin' to mind like you been through war
You don't know about war, you just lips up whores
Causin' a massacre without a chainsaw
Robbin' the rich, don't care about the law
[?] if you saw what I saw then [?] you can't ignore
That's why I'm juggin' over and over again, like the song from Nelly and Tim McGraw
Nobody made me, T town raised me
I helped you appease, you're better repayin' me
Get livered when it's all [?]
But no beg when I start, nah, you can't persuade me
That's why I've been anti lately
People wanna take and not give back, crazy
Boot him with my left foot like Leon Bailey
Think I won't do it? I'ma do it like Sadie
Mashallah, free up the Gullah
Gettin' to the pound you wrote or the dollar
Can't sabotage man, I got tips, I'm Maradona
Flick at the flicks, man my enemy a runner
My heart don't care about your racks like [?]
Got a mind of my own, do what I wanna
Poonani is good, but I could never love her
So I Pretty Woman her, just workin' undercover
Deep on the roads, deep on the roads
Trust me, it really gets deep on the roads

And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Or lee, I speak the truth
Cuz the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Cuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'

But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream, oh
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me?
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

What goes up must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me?
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down

I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you

How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
[Verse 2]
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
[Pre-Chorus]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found (Got found)

And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand"

Than a birth of two souls in one

Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream"

Beauty queen of only eighteen

She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

You come any time you want, yeah"

Kids forget me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone
Let my start your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so salty and I get respect
You don't have to look no farter, you dealin with the hoe with your lada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town

My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in

Get this party rolling (rolling)
Just wait
I can’t even eat this food that’s up on my plate
Going to sleep hungry by choice no mistake
Can you relate?
People starving and I’m depriving myself
Wonder what’s it gonna take for me to get pride in myself
Whoa, all these loads off are gonna take its toll
Weight loss, weight gain, it’s just outta control
Ain’t talking 50 Cent
You know my mob ain’t deep
My remix isn’t even fresh out of the kitchen
Anticipating when you will cross me
Hoping that you’ll off me
Gun to my head then all i see is red, yeah
What, I can’t talk about depression?
I get it you’re perfect just for the record
Give it to me I’ll wreck it
No lie just expect it
All this pain in my heart is why I’m so reckless, I’m reckless
I’m reckless.."

Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'mma keep on flossin', poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat

Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings, nigga you don't know me"

I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left

You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,"""

Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go

When I drugged the bitch, the drug I could've melt
I'm feelin' so fine in the back of my Hummer
Ridin' down a main street, I'm stuntin' like a winner
I've been in the running for a long time
I feel it's safe to say that DPalm can bust a bomb rhyme
When I write down a verse, there ain't no controversy
Look at your bitch, she's fifteen, call that statutory
Smokin' on Arabian shit, don't you know? the good stuff
The smoke hit the back of your throat, the shit is rough
Told you suckers, DPalm gonna murder this investigation
Who's the next bad rapper? Turnin' on a mutilator
Fry you bitches up in, what is called frialator
I worked at fast food, don't fuck with what I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the next rapper on TV
I just wanna be me, enough about succeeding

Drinkin 'til we daze-y, knockin' back down shots of Bacardi

Like I was gonna put a ""Fuck you"" in front of my merchants' eyes

Don't be foolish, that plot's kinda like the flick ""Mission: Impossible""
Your homeboy's sayin' shit that got me actin' kinda pausible

Concoct your own acronym for ""Prez is gonna spray""
Best believe me, I'll do it, my words are the truest
And I will throw some shit that leaves you lyin' in your fluids

So we can be broadcast live, like cable TV
I'm new to this league, but great like John Wall

Quero te deixar perfeita mesmo sem grana
Ser cafetão não é fácil, confie em mim, eu sei
Quando gangsteres e vadias
Vão, vão, vão, vão, vão, vão juntos
Tipo chinchila e clima ruim
Estou de boa, mas já estive melhor
Todos meus parceiros, grana e coisas glamourosas
Peguei alguns carros, uma casa com uma ala leste e uma oeste
Porque esse é o jeito que eu vivo e vocês mulheres sabem os segredos
De como tirar proveito disso
Como me pegar na minha fraqueza
Porque o poder da B-U-C-E-T-A
Faz vários manos se perguntarem, eu não sou o único
Você tem que continuar deixando seu dinheiro vir e isso é pela minha vida

Cancel that phone (Yes)
The only sound I'm tryin' to hear is your moan (Yes)
You ridin' topless, no panties on (Yes)
And I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
You're giving me the fire though.."
2005,98,Mississippi Girl,Faith Hill,https://genius.com/Faith-hill-mississippi-girl-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Well, it's a 
long way
 from 
Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singin' on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight
[Verse 2]
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been
[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl (Woo)
[Verse 3]
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasin' dreams, yeah"
2005,99,Number One Spot,Ludacris,https://genius.com/Ludacris-number-one-spot-lyrics,"[Intro]
Yeah, baby! Hehe, yeah
(Woo!) Back again! (That's right)
Luda!
Hahahaha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feeling real good, too (Holla at 'em, man)
What up, Uncle 'Face?
 (Yeah!)
Haha, haha
I'm a bull in this industry, man (Tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (Nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout, right? (You know what's up, right?)
Look—
[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me (Surprise!)
It's a celebration, and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (Bow!)
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!"
2005,100,Give Me That,Webbie featuring Bun B,https://genius.com/Webbie-give-me-that-lyrics,"[Intro: Webbie]
(Oh) Girl give me that
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that
Girl give me that (pussy)
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that
Girl give me that (pussy)
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that there
Girl give me that pussy
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that
[Verse 1: Webbie]
You know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl I want it just as bad as you do
And look see I can tell from this lil vibe
You got me feeling that you dig me
Boo I'm digging you too
You wanna be one of the chosen few
Then gon jig up in this motherfucker
Maybe me and you can do it big up in this motherfucker
Sit you in a crib where you can chill
Don't have to move a muscle
Give you some be good now you be good
Daddy gon hustle
Come here let me Whisper in your ear
I gotta tell you something
Listening to this song kinda make a nigga want something
Did some daydreaming
Now I'm fiending like I'm on something
Girl don't hold it from me
Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya
I ain't the type to ruin your life
By running game and throwing your dreams
Get in your brain suit your game
Ease your pain and show you things
Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes
Girl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame"
2006,1,Bad Day,Daniel Powter,https://genius.com/Daniel-powter-bad-day-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on
[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day, you're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know, you tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day, the camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
[Verse 3]
Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on"

My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end"

2006,6,Unwritten,Natasha Bedingfield,https://genius.com/Natasha-bedingfield-unwritten-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending: unplanned
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
[Chorus]
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten"

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space, mm
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mm
[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice, mm
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me"
2006,8,Ridin',Chamillionaire featuring Krayzie Bone,https://genius.com/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-ridin-by-chamillionaire-feat-krayzie-bone-lyrics,"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic.
 Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...
They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty
He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen
Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
AUGH!!! *calms down* 
Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while

Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma
Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…"

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
[Verse 2]
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between"

2006,25,"Lean wit It, Rock wit It",Dem Franchize Boyz featuring Peanut and Charlay,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

2006,26,What Hurts the Most,Rascal Flatts,https://genius.com/Rascal-flatts-what-hurts-the-most-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me
[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do
[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
That I left unspoken"

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and"
2006,28,Unfaithful,Rihanna,https://genius.com/Rihanna-unfaithful-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well"

2006,34,Gold Digger,Kanye West featuring Jamie Foxx,https://genius.com/Apologetix-bone-digger-lyrics,"== Bone Digger ==
Parody of ""Gold Digger"" by Kanye West (Featuring Jamie Foxx)
(Romans 1:18-25, Job 40:15-41:34)
They make a monkey right out of me -- Yes, they've been tryin' endlessly
Overeager bonediggers -- they never found that jigsaw piece
They make a monkey right out of me -- It makes for funky biology
I'm not the kid of some hominid, who comes from a lizard, whose mama was a fish
Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I say evolution don't figure
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers, but I ain't never seen no holes bigger
It sounds like no evidence found, it sounds like their heads in the ground
It sounds like they're just too proud, it sounds quite boneheaded
You need to ponder whether evolution is wrong
Whether maybe you was put on under cover of dawn
They said, ""We can tell from rocks, we tell by the carbon""
'Cause this world has gotta flock of descendants of Charles Robert Darwin
But I'm lookin' for the odds at casinos
That life could come to be from random acids amino
Zero -- we know it's hocus pocus
And they wanna make all of that an accidental process?
O.K., let's pretend a fishy got some kids
That stood up on their fins and crawled up on land
Without evidence and here we are today
If you're trustin' in this worldview you better have faith
You know why? They make too much of nothin'
Stuff that I've heard it should have been on Mythbusters
Their best forensic samples couldn't cut the mustard
You don't care what none of us say you still trust it
(They make a monkey) Now I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (right out of me)
But I say evolution don't figure (It makes for funky)
Now, I ain't hatin' on the bone diggers (biology)
But I ain't never seen no holes bigger (I'm not the kid)
It sounds like no evidence found (of some hominid)
It sounds like their heads in the ground (who comes from a lizard)
It sounds like they're just too proud (whose mama was a fish)
It sounds quite boneheaded
1859's the fateful year -- they've had 150 years to prove their great new theory
I know some funny ways they found support for some of it, kids
They made some hominids from parts of gibbons and pigs
Your museums are deceiving when you visit one they
Take a couple bones pawn it off as a primate
They were s'posed to find all sorts of life forms we could study
They went to the rocks and got dinosaurs in the muddy
They're talkin' down actin' like the Bible is so funny
Could've got dinos sooner if they tried Job 41-y
If it ain't no bunk, holler ""We want proof now, we want proof now, yeah!""
It's somethin' that'll make you mad
Cause all the links they had were either weak or bad
Great big digs since the 1860's
And after waiting and searchin' they found out it doesn't exist?
CHORUS
Now I ain't hating on the bone digger, no, not me
I've found trilobites in stone and some petrified trees
You know evolution ain't paleontology
Transition forms are lackin' -- got a hole up his sleeve
But -- the other option's not fun
So he gonna make you into a man out of that pond scum
This is his religion baby, don't be surprised
That fishy on all fours on his jeep's his messiah
So, let's no fight -- I won't abuse Darwin 'cause that's not nice
And they're gonna keep stallin' and tryin' to prove they're right though
And when you catch on we'll lead you back to the Bible

2006,35,Money Maker,Ludacris featuring Pharrell,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space"

Yeah, it's my life (
Hey, Hailie

In my own words, I guess
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know"

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

Hey there, Delilah, I know times are gettin' hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all"

Struggle to memorize

The pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath and after that, after that
I tried to get you back
[Pre-Chorus]
(But) I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me somethin' to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what we're goin' through
I get behind, you make your move
Forget about the truth"

This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply"

And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around
[Chorus]
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over
[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away"

2007,21,Give It to Me,Timbaland featuring Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake,https://genius.com/Timbaland-give-it-to-me-lyrics,"[Intro: Timbaland]
Is it goin'? Is it goin'?
Is it goin'? Is it going?
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on
[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado]
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly
I seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel
 
and mommy — sí, mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video for ""Promiscuous""
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous-ulous-ulous
[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
[Verse 2: Timbaland]
When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple grand
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts — I heard 'em, I'm not a fan
Niggas talkin' greedy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can"
2007,22,What Goes Around... Comes Around,Justin Timberlake,https://genius.com/Justin-timberlake-what-goes-around-comes-around-lyrics,"[Part I: What Goes Around...]
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't wanna think about it (Uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (Uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Is this the way it's really goin' down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find"
2007,23,Cupid's Chokehold,Gym Class Heroes featuring Patrick Stump,https://genius.com/Gym-class-heroes-cupids-chokehold-breakfast-in-america-lyrics,"[Intro: Patrick Stump]
Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)"
2007,24,How to Save a Life,The Fray,https://genius.com/The-fray-how-to-save-a-life-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and"
2007,25,Home,Daughtry,https://genius.com/Daughtry-home-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I'm staring out into the night
Trying to hide the pain
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain
[Chorus]
Well, I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So, I'm going home
Well, I'm going home
[Verse 2]
The miles are getting longer, it seems
The closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true
And I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try"

Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar, meu—
[Verso 1: Justin Timberlake]
Se eu te escrevesse uma sinfonia
Só para dizer o quanto você significa para mim (O que você faria?)
Se eu dissesse que você é linda
Você sairia comigo regularmente? (Me diga, você sairia?)
Bem, baby, eu estive ao redor do mundo
Mas eu não me vi outra garota (Como você)
Esse anel aqui representa o meu coração
Mas há apenas uma coisa que eu preciso dе você (Diga ""Eu aceito"")
Porque
[Refrão: Justin Timberlake e 
Timbaland
]
Eu consigo ver a gеnte de mãos dadas
Caminhando na praia, nossos pés na areia
Eu posso ver a gente no campo
Sentados na grama, deitados lado a lado
Você pode ser o meu amor
Deixa eu te transformar na minha dama, garota, você me surpreende
Não precisa fazer nenhuma loucura
Veja, tudo que eu quero que você faça é ser o meu amor (
Então não ceda
)
Meu amor (
Então não ceda

Meu amor (
Então não ceda

Não existe outra mulher que poderia tomar o seu lugar
Meu amor (

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters"

I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glistened (Ballin'!)
But I spent about 8 grand

See, it started at the park, used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart, that's when we fell apart

They say we're too young to get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said that we couldn't last together (Last together)

See, it's very defined, you're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind, you haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy"

I am an arms dealer, fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate (Do-do-do-do-do)
Oh so intricate, yeah (Do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate (Do-do-do-do-do)
Oh so intricate, yeah (Do-do-do-do-do-do)

I wrote the gospel on giving up
(
You're looking pretty sinking

But the real bombshells have already sunk

Prima donnas of the gutter

At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties"

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (

And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame

And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll

Better put your fingers back to the keys...

Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so

Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time

Your subtleties, they strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all
[Pre-Chorus]
The walls start breathin', my mind's unweavin'
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evenin'
I give the final blow
[Chorus]
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
[Verse 2]
A fallin' star, at least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
You're findin' things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathin', my mind's unweavin'
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evenin'
I give the final blow"

Now when I holla A Bay Bay, I'm finna get my groove on
It's so hot up in the club that I ain't got no shoes on
Holdin' up a big stack of dem hunnids in a rubber band
So don't ask me for no cash
Cause I'm not that other man
Everybody tripping cause I'm limping when I'm walking
And I'm pimping when I'm talking
I don't trick 'em when I'm talking
Them boys in the back
They be rollin' up they dopey
And they blow until choke
And that's what got his got his game flossin'
Wen I see a bad chick I'm hollerin' out A Bay Bay
Hope ya'll ain't with your boyfriend
Cuz I don't care what they say
And I don't care what he say, or she say
I'm in the DJ booth takin' pics. with the DJ
You wanna know what we say
When the clubs get crunk (wat) A Bay Bay
Let it play that's my song turn it up (ok)

Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it

Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you

You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real, real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough
[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later"

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them, your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up, would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned?""

Sometimes, I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times, I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it"

First time I caught her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right (Game right)
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, ""I 'on't usually do this, I 'on't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya, baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life"" (Ha!)
I got her trained, now she suck me with ice

That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be"

With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves?
 
Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
'Cause I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)
Shut up and drive (Drive, drive, drive)

Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back

Were in my life just to get high on

And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come, get to play it up
All my life to sacrifice

To the well once more, time to decide on
When it's killin' me, when will I really see

When it's killin' me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?"

2008,5,Apologize,Timbaland featuring OneRepublic,https://genius.com/Nvp-summer-playlist-2015-annotated,"Finding good music can be a challenge.
 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

2008,7,Love Song,Sara Bareilles,https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-love-song-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
[Pre-Chorus]
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah
[Verse 2]
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry"

I see you, Ryan
Yo, Keith, you was right
But we just getting started
Yeah, man

You say you're 
searchin' for somebody
 that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby and let Daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you gotta do is tell me what you're sippin' on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin' all night long
[Pre-Chorus 1: Usher]
Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that, shawty, I got a thing for you
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it
I can tell by the way you're lookin' at me, girl
[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)

Sweep the streets I used to own

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world"

Oh, can you see what I've seen?

Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is ""ooh""

In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away

And the note that said"

I'm tired of niggas playin' it crazy, like, man, you ain't done talkin', I'm 'bout to
ShittyBoyz shit
Think you better than me, but I'm Kobe, you ain't—
[Verse]
Think you better than me, but I'm Kobe, [?]
I'm tryna have a mill' before I'm tryna have a baby (No cap)
Broke-ass nigga might as well go join the navy (Broke ass)
Don't test your luck with me, you better off playin' the daily
'Fit six plus like the old iPhone
How you say you gettin' money, askin' for a ride home?
No way he say I'm weak, he must ain't heard my song
I'm the type to agree even though I'm not wrong
'Cause ten times out of tеn I disagree, how niggas think?
We ain't on the same pagе, ain't no point for us to link
Fucked up 'cause it's been a minute since I had a drink
If I was on the Titanic, let me fuck before we sink
All this water on my neck, I guess I'm really in the deep end
Just by how we fuckin', we can never just be friends
Doggy bone a demon, he just really popped a pink 10
You can make it wherever you from, it just depend (On what?)
If you got it in you (Yop)
I got dog shit in my pocket and it's not a [?]
I can tell by how it feel, it is not official
I live in the Murder Mitten, so I got a pistol
Would you whip this bitch if it jam up?
I know you see him down bad, pick your mans up (Pick him up)
Bad bitch want me to put her in some handcuffs (Shit)
Fuck the haters, I know they always be sayin' stuff (Man, fuck 'em)
Dee this, Dee that, get the fuck off Dee dick
You ain't been where I've been, you ain't really seen shit
So it's fuck you and whatever you got to say
'Cause I got more money than you at the end of the day
Let that get through your head like an x-ray
Baby, if you down to your last, [?] sextape
Who the fuck broke? I got more commas than an essay
Now I live every day like it's my birthday (Live it up)
From the East Coast but I got more blues than Compton (All blues)
Fuck around and get jacked, askin' me what's poppin'
Flippin' on the gas for a minute, I ain't stoppin' (Skrrt)
Can't believe she really fucked the gang, homie hoppin' (Damn)
Can't believe it, damn, I feel like T-Pain and Lil Wayne
Ice got my nose runnin', I don't do no cocaine
Bitch, don't even bring that nigga up 'cause he so lame
Baby, you can fuck me like a ho, don't have no shame
You can tell just by the fabric that it cost a couple thou'
Show my bitch my bank account, the only thing she said was ""wow""
When I'm walkin', all rise, you niggas better bow
I wear what I wanna wear, I don't care if it's not the style
I go where I wanna go, but you can't 'cause you whipless
Man, I really can't believe niggas dyin' over bitches
Please don't ask what are we 'cause I'ma tell your ass finished
I be always talkin' shit, I need to go to the dentist
Don't know what you doin', lookin' like you need a lesson
Life been [?] good, haven't had no time for stressin' (Good as hell)
Always want more, got a lil' money obsession
Reason why I'm always on some green like some dressing (Need it)
Reason why I'm banded up like I got a cut
He ain't even sent no shots back, all he do is duck
I'ma have to smack the next nigga, talkin' 'bout I suck
I been in this for a minute, ain't no way I'm givin' up (No way)"

If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed
[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be"

It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh, but I'm taking them back

What should matter to me

The best thing 'bout tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because 
tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find
[Verse 2]
This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
Or I won't live to see another day, I swear it's true

We have been together as a couple for 5 years
Kept you as a secret from my parents for a few years
'Cause they knew all the stories about your wicked ways
Seven rounds with you really makes me weak for days
I am under your spell and you make me bow down
When I try to get you outta my system like Bow Wow
You whisper in my ear tеlling me to calm down
On top of me and you make mе cum down
I tell you all my problems, you're like my therapist
Every time I am around you, my mind's a peace
All the secrets of my life, you always kept them safe
And I shared you with my brother, we had threesome sex
I'm addicted to you, I am a simp
Coz every time I want you, I pay a pimp
He exhibits you for men to ride, he's a pimp
And why am I stuck in this relationship?

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

Now even though I try to play it off

And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you
Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

2008,66,Get Like Me,David Banner featuring Chris Brown and Yung Joc,https://genius.com/David-foster-wallace-signifying-rappers-annotated,"""The schools in a portion of Boston stretching from just south of South Boston through Roxbury and into Dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas.""
Morgan v. Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974
THE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. ""Yeah,"" a new friend says, ""Whas up. Whas goin on."" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. 
""Before we start this next record…,"" Schooly's saying.
 
The record in question is called ""Signifying Rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of
 
Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.
The black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then.
 On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""Them"" from wherever it is ""They"" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.
Uniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. 
Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen.
 And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting 
the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.
Not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with 
James Brown over the radio.
""Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud!""
Except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, ""I'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.
""Say it loud
I'm mmm hum proud
Say it loud
Mum hum hum proud!""
But rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:"

I'm not loving you way I wanted to

And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-no""
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
See, I had to go, see, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life

2008,79,Good Life,Kanye West featuring T-Pain,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & (Bobby V)]
Yeah, doin' a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop, haha
She got me thinking I can date a cop, haha
Cause her uniform fit her so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in her car, she cut off all the lights
She said I have the right, to remain silent
Now I got her hollering, sounding like a siren
Talking 'bout (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) yeah
(Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) Yeah (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) yeah
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high, a-bove the law
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the streets
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talking 'bout (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee, wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee)
Yeah (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) yeah"
2008,92,7 Things,Miley Cyrus,https://genius.com/Miley-cyrus-7-things-lyrics,"[Intro]
(Sha, sha, sha)
[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear
[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, 
your games
, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent, as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here"
2008,93,You're Gonna Miss This,Trace Adkins,https://genius.com/Trace-adkins-youre-gonna-miss-this-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you
[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down
[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this"
2008,94,Love Remains the Same,Gavin Rossdale,https://genius.com/Gavin-rossdale-love-remains-the-same-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
Everything we know fades to black
[Pre-Chorus]
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
[Chorus]
I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
[Verse 2]
Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for the space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they're all the same"
2008,95,Feels Like Tonight,Daughtry,https://genius.com/Daughtry-feels-like-tonight-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me
""Come and take a look inside""
You believe me
In every single lie
But I, I failed you this time
[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight
[Verse 2]
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right
[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight"

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, let's take it slow
So as for you, well, you know where to go
I wanna take my love and hate you 'til the end
[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away
[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Yeah"
2008,98,Into the Night,Santana featuring Chad Kroeger,https://genius.com/Santana-into-the-night-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in-between you I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang"

Sent from heaven
Sent from heaven
[Verse 1]
Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken a few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away 
(When love)
And you can't help who you love 
(Just can't help who you love)
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause
[Chorus]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from 
(Sent from heaven)
 (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from 
(Sent from heaven)
 (Ooh, 'cause)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from 
(Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh"

Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It's on and poppin tonight 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
'Cause we be ballin', it's 
platinum Patron

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?"

Was all but won
We're all alone
Smokin' his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""

When everything was fallin' apart?
Where all my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

Surrounded, surrounded

2009,20,Down,Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne,https://genius.com/Todd-in-the-shadows-from-the-vaults-down-by-jay-sean-ft-lil-wayne-annotated,"[Intro]
Hello, everybody. I'm finally putting my YouTube videos up all in one place. People have been telling me I needed to do that for a long time so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do a little intro on all of them. You see, I'd been kicking around the idea of doing reviews, I'd seen, 
The Nostalgia Critic
 and 
Angry Video Game Nerd,
 I'd seen them do it for a long time and a huge fan. And I'd never found a good reason or, the motivation to actually try it and then I had the idea to do the pop song reviews. And I'd been writing, reviews of songs in my blog – which is long gone by now, you can't find it – but I'd been doing reviews on my blog for a long time. 
And, I was scared of showing my face, then I had this great idea of this image of this silhouette guy sitting at his piano – he can play piano and I just loved the image of it so I couldn't stop myself from doing it.
 I was just so excited by it and this is the first episode, the humble, very humble beginning of Todd In The Shadows. This was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be and I'm not sure why I picked such an innocuous song to start off with – who's really bothered by ""Down"" by Jay Sean? And I started on it, I figured it would be easy, and I found out I couldn't figure out how to do anything: I didn't know how to act, I didn't know how to write, I didn't know how to edit, I didn't know how to film, I didn't know how to frame – I still 
[laughs]
 don't know how much I've really learned about this since I've started but, eh, you had to start somewhere. I started with this for some reason. It's rough but it was a start, so – ""Down"" by Jay Sean, enjoy.
[Review]
                                            ""Down"" by Jay Sean
                                                   ft/Lil Wayne
                                             A pop song review
[Todd playing ""Down"" on the piano]
Hello, friends! If you'll just give me a moment, I'd like to indulge in one of my favorite past-times: over-analyzing cheap pop songs. So, there's one song I wanna look at in particular – you may have heard it – it's Jay Sean's ""Down.""
[Clip: ""Down"" by Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne]
Now, maybe you don't pay attention to the pop charts but I do and this song is everywhere
 – I mean, it's on the pop stations, it's on the country stations, it's on the gospel stations, the Rush Limbaugh stations, 
and it's an impressive feat for a song that's only a word long.
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
See? He even rhymes ""down"" with 
""down!""
 Although I can't be too surprised it's a hit song right now – I mean, it sounds like everything else on the radio, I mean 
everything
 else.
You down, down, down, down?
[Clip: ""Low"" by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain]
Low, low, low, low
[Clip: ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" by Akon]
Right now, na, na
[Clip: ""With You"" by Chris Brown]
With you, with you, with you, with you
I've never heard a song that sounds this much like everything. I mean, 
it even has the now-required cameo from Lil Wayne,
 
who always sounds like he's going through puberty.
Down like she supposed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause, to me, she's zero degrees
Uh... did Lil Wayne just lose control of his metaphor there? I always thought if you say a girl's zero degrees frozen, that means she 
wasn't
 into you. I don't know. 
Also, why is he dressed like the guy from The White Stripes?
Cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
Did he just say ""She's my Miss America"" and then salute a British flag?
[Todd shrugs]
Honestly, I'm down like the economy
Ha! That's clever... ""down like the economy."" I don't have a job. Thanks for the reminder, Lil Wayne.
Here's an interesting fact: Jay Sean is the first major pop singer of Sikh descent.
Yeah, that's right. Just goes to show you that the pop charts are an all-inclusive place, open to all creeds and all colors and all cultures as long as they sound like everything else.
I'm kinda amused that the guy's named Jay Sean. He just had to have a name as generic as his song.
 I mean, it's Jay Sean! You know Jay Sean, I know Jay Sean, everyone knows Jay Sean! Jay Sean's a star, we live in a Jay Sean era of music. Jay Sean, Jay... we've already got a bunch of Jays.
And we've already got a bunch of Seans.
We certainly don't need a Jay Sean. Hey, wait a minute, is this the same guy that did ""Tipsy"" a few years back?
[Clip: ""Tipsy"" by J-Kwon]
You know, ""Tipsy"" in ""Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy!""
(Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy)
Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy
[Todd sighs]
 No, I am informed that this is, in fact, 
J-Kwon
. 
J-Kwon, not Jay Sean.
 
[Todd sighs]
I mean, I don't even hate this song. I kinda like this song a little. It's just something you don't think about – it just goes through you. You don't wake up in the morning wanting to hear ""Down"" by Jay Sean. It's not something you can connect to. I mean, ""Are you down?"" is not really a very romantic sentiment. ""Do you agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree? Are you comfortable with the terms of this proposal?"" I mean, if you're going to be repeating one word over and over again, why is it ""down?"" Why isn't it something like ""love"" or ""yours"" or ""forever"" or... uh, forever. Hey, hold on, lemme check something here.
[Todd plays the piano and sings]
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down?
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you—
Oh, my God! It's ""Forever"" by Chris Brown!
[Clip: ""Forever"" by Chris Brown]
""Down"" by Jay Sean is the same as ""Forever"" by Chris Brown! I mean, the melodies are a little different but, mostly, it's the same song!
You won't be lonely
Double your pleasure
I mean, they got the same tempo,
 they got the same chord structure, they're both about whisking away on a magic, flying carpet to the eternal dance floor of love. There's not a major difference! This is great! This is just great because ""Forever"" was Chris Brown's only good song, and now we don't even have to listen to that anymore 'cause we've got Jay Sean's ""Down"" to replace it 
so we can just delete this guy from the cultural memory banks forever. Awesome. See, Jay Sean, you do have a purpose: you're the new and improved Chris Brown.

NOW WITH 31% LESS DOMESTIC ABUSE!
That's great, I'm glad you're around.
[Todd plays the piano and sings]
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down...
                                                        
THE END

But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse, the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you, hoes"

When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken

Waitin' for me to come home

Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly it's like a battlefield
One word turns into war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Do me that favor, 'cause I like your flavor
My manage behavior, I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player

Give me reason to fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies

There was nowhere to hide

2009,62,Empire State of Mind,Jay-Z featuring Alicia Keys,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
[Verse 2]
Said, ""We can fire it up and I can show you around""
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house"

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to

'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around"

See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most

Raise your glasses for a toast"

And I thought I loved you then

Pode não significar nada pra vocês
Mas entendam, nada foi feito por mim
Então, eu não pretendo parar de forma alguma
Eu quero essa merda pra sempre, mano, sempre, mano, sempre, mano

E falando pra toda garota que ela é a única pra mim
E eu nem tô planejando ligar
Eu quero essa merda pra sempre, mano, sempre, mano, sempre, mano

Sobrenome Todos, primeiro nome Melhor
Tipo uma torção no tornozelo, garoto, eu não tô de brincadeira
Comecei localmеnte, mas graças a todos os haters
Eu conheço os pilotos do G-IV pеlo primeiro nome
Na sua cidade, bêbado com o marrom, Nino
Ela insiste que tem mais classe, nós sabemos
Nadando no dinheiro, venha e me encontre, Nemo
Se eu estive no clube, você sabe que eu me diverti, quimio
Lancei a mixtape, aquela merda parecia um álbum
Quem teria pensado que uma turnê pelo país seria o resultado?
As gravadoras querem meu nome ao lado de um X, igual o Malcolm
Todo mundo tem um acordo, eu fiz isso sem um
Yeah, mano, eu comando meu negócio
Tô matando todos esses rappers, você poderia jurar que eu tinha uma lista de sucesso
Todos que duvidaram de mim estão pedindo perdão

We need more bottles, tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here, hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can't get it up
On my neck, on my wrist, everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clicquot 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up (Hey)
If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance"

On the front lobe of my left-side brains

I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction

And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind"

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

Wish right now, wish right now
[Verse 1: 2Pac- Hold on Be Strong lyrics mix]
There's, never a good day
Cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days
Sometimes it hurts to pray
And every Halloween
Check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth
Sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
And if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise
So keep ya head up
And even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
So keep ya head up
And make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day...
Dear Lord can you hear me!!"

(Matthew 2:11; Mark 15:23; John 11:49-52, 19:39; Isaiah 53:1-12; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7)
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
Like in bowling when you got your first strike
It's like now I'm hitchhiking on the turnpike
I broke free from doin' life, now it's midnight
Then God comes along with a ride, invites me inside
I offer stuff to compensate
He doesn't want no payment – says, Brother, it's all be covered
It's tough to take – I say, Lord, I'm a lousy clown, why'd You stop to save me
You must be crazy, man, I'm such a waste
Where we goin'? I'm redeeming you – no you ain't
I'm bad, and someone like that can't become a saint
It's too ingrained – He said, there's no one good – you're goin' straight
I took command, and I'm winnin' you back – your soul is saved
But, Lord, my past was awful, I feel so estranged
I'm trapped – Who trapped you? I don't see no ball and chain
I laid hands on you – you'll never do this alone again
I guess you don't know the Lord's grace"

2010,13,BedRock,Young Money featuring Lloyd,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

2010,24,Not Afraid,Eminem,https://genius.com/Eminem-not-afraid-lyrics,"[Intro]
(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid)
 
Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand)
 
It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody)
 
I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand)
 
Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm)
 
Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm)
 
Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
 If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
 Just follow me, I'll get you there
[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world,
 
feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From 
Infinite
 down to the last 
Relapse
 album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
 
like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse,
 
forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe"

Remember the first time we met?
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hoping you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
[Pre-Chorus]
(That girl) like something off a poster
(That girl) is a dime they say
(That girl) is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy"

Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva

It's just a rumor, and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothin' like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothin' you can compare to your neighborhood ho

Without bein' disrespectful

Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her closе

I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even

She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake, she's no trouble sleeping

What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gon' stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even, even, no

And what am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're okay?

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall
[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind
[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead"

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head,
 
a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack

Please take me away from here

'Cause I feel like such an insomniac

Please take me away from here

Why do I tire of counting sheep

Please take me away from here

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

2010,38,Carry Out,Timbaland featuring Justin Timberlake,https://genius.com/Nvp-summer-playlist-2015-annotated,"Finding good music can be a challenge.
 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down
[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility
[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me

2010,41,Down,Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne,https://genius.com/Todd-in-the-shadows-from-the-vaults-down-by-jay-sean-ft-lil-wayne-annotated,"[Intro]
Hello, everybody. I'm finally putting my YouTube videos up all in one place. People have been telling me I needed to do that for a long time so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do a little intro on all of them. You see, I'd been kicking around the idea of doing reviews, I'd seen, 
The Nostalgia Critic
 and 
Angry Video Game Nerd,
 I'd seen them do it for a long time and a huge fan. And I'd never found a good reason or, the motivation to actually try it and then I had the idea to do the pop song reviews. And I'd been writing, reviews of songs in my blog – which is long gone by now, you can't find it – but I'd been doing reviews on my blog for a long time. 
And, I was scared of showing my face, then I had this great idea of this image of this silhouette guy sitting at his piano – he can play piano and I just loved the image of it so I couldn't stop myself from doing it.
 I was just so excited by it and this is the first episode, the humble, very humble beginning of Todd In The Shadows. This was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be and I'm not sure why I picked such an innocuous song to start off with – who's really bothered by ""Down"" by Jay Sean? And I started on it, I figured it would be easy, and I found out I couldn't figure out how to do anything: I didn't know how to act, I didn't know how to write, I didn't know how to edit, I didn't know how to film, I didn't know how to frame – I still 
[laughs]
 don't know how much I've really learned about this since I've started but, eh, you had to start somewhere. I started with this for some reason. It's rough but it was a start, so – ""Down"" by Jay Sean, enjoy.
[Review]
                                            ""Down"" by Jay Sean
                                                   ft/Lil Wayne
                                             A pop song review
[Todd playing ""Down"" on the piano]
Hello, friends! If you'll just give me a moment, I'd like to indulge in one of my favorite past-times: over-analyzing cheap pop songs. So, there's one song I wanna look at in particular – you may have heard it – it's Jay Sean's ""Down.""
[Clip: ""Down"" by Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne]
Now, maybe you don't pay attention to the pop charts but I do and this song is everywhere
 – I mean, it's on the pop stations, it's on the country stations, it's on the gospel stations, the Rush Limbaugh stations, 
and it's an impressive feat for a song that's only a word long.
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
See? He even rhymes ""down"" with 
""down!""
 Although I can't be too surprised it's a hit song right now – I mean, it sounds like everything else on the radio, I mean 
everything
 else.
You down, down, down, down?
[Clip: ""Low"" by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain]
Low, low, low, low
[Clip: ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" by Akon]
Right now, na, na
[Clip: ""With You"" by Chris Brown]
With you, with you, with you, with you
I've never heard a song that sounds this much like everything. I mean, 
it even has the now-required cameo from Lil Wayne,
 
who always sounds like he's going through puberty.
Down like she supposed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause, to me, she's zero degrees
Uh... did Lil Wayne just lose control of his metaphor there? I always thought if you say a girl's zero degrees frozen, that means she 
wasn't
 into you. I don't know. 
Also, why is he dressed like the guy from The White Stripes?
Cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
Did he just say ""She's my Miss America"" and then salute a British flag?
[Todd shrugs]
Honestly, I'm down like the economy
Ha! That's clever... ""down like the economy."" I don't have a job. Thanks for the reminder, Lil Wayne.
Here's an interesting fact: Jay Sean is the first major pop singer of Sikh descent.
Yeah, that's right. Just goes to show you that the pop charts are an all-inclusive place, open to all creeds and all colors and all cultures as long as they sound like everything else.
I'm kinda amused that the guy's named Jay Sean. He just had to have a name as generic as his song.
 I mean, it's Jay Sean! You know Jay Sean, I know Jay Sean, everyone knows Jay Sean! Jay Sean's a star, we live in a Jay Sean era of music. Jay Sean, Jay... we've already got a bunch of Jays.
And we've already got a bunch of Seans.
We certainly don't need a Jay Sean. Hey, wait a minute, is this the same guy that did ""Tipsy"" a few years back?
[Clip: ""Tipsy"" by J-Kwon]
You know, ""Tipsy"" in ""Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy!""
(Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy)
Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy
[Todd sighs]
 No, I am informed that this is, in fact, 
J-Kwon
. 
J-Kwon, not Jay Sean.
 
[Todd sighs]
I mean, I don't even hate this song. I kinda like this song a little. It's just something you don't think about – it just goes through you. You don't wake up in the morning wanting to hear ""Down"" by Jay Sean. It's not something you can connect to. I mean, ""Are you down?"" is not really a very romantic sentiment. ""Do you agree, agree, agree, agree, agree, agree? Are you comfortable with the terms of this proposal?"" I mean, if you're going to be repeating one word over and over again, why is it ""down?"" Why isn't it something like ""love"" or ""yours"" or ""forever"" or... uh, forever. Hey, hold on, lemme check something here.
[Todd plays the piano and sings]
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down?
It's like I've waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you—
Oh, my God! It's ""Forever"" by Chris Brown!
[Clip: ""Forever"" by Chris Brown]
""Down"" by Jay Sean is the same as ""Forever"" by Chris Brown! I mean, the melodies are a little different but, mostly, it's the same song!
You won't be lonely
Double your pleasure
I mean, they got the same tempo,
 they got the same chord structure, they're both about whisking away on a magic, flying carpet to the eternal dance floor of love. There's not a major difference! This is great! This is just great because ""Forever"" was Chris Brown's only good song, and now we don't even have to listen to that anymore 'cause we've got Jay Sean's ""Down"" to replace it 
so we can just delete this guy from the cultural memory banks forever. Awesome. See, Jay Sean, you do have a purpose: you're the new and improved Chris Brown.

I'm having fun, don't put me down

Burning bridges shore to shore

I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around

To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt"

It's the time to chew up the skin to cut through with a pin
It's not a fuckin' thing
It's not even a fuckin' sin
I'm mad so I always bring out my pen and pad
Take this bin and say goodnight to my dad
Do my raps
Shout out the rhymes
Read the Scottish Time when I'm done then kill myself with 3 fuckin' knifes
I've gone pop doing Hip-Hop
Time goes by and I don't know how
I'm tapin' this hoe but she's a horrible cow so before you fuck this whore then shut the fuckin' door

I'm ready for this
A fight to fight
I'm not losing
I'm here and always will be yo... for eternal

When young used to chap my homies door but he was always staying with his sister of a whore
Loved this boy so much hardcore
I still meet me, do some raps and adore
Endure and endore this long-term friendship we have
Homieship is beautiful, this world isn't
For sins I have a lota time to repent
Rapping at school before a nasty email been sent
I rap with another homie who is like a bro to me, I call him bro anyway
No ones stoppin' me
He's ok, I'm ok so every asshole in the world should be ok
Winters coming, no I don't mean get your Christmas stuff ready

I'm no maniac
I don't kill, in fact don't even pay a bill so watch your lips before your wrong words starts to spill
I don't fuck around, may you will like a cashier not opening the till
Fuck your money I'm just going on a kill so better watch out
Bang gun shots going off
I need medication for my cough
It's tough but life's not enough
Went through Hell so when Satan calls don't ring the bell
I'm just gonna rap so if you meet him don't tell

A fight to fight
I'm not losing
I'm here and always will be yo... for eternal

First rap I heard was Baby by Justin Bieber featuring Ludicris when doing a MJ song for CD in a recording studio
It was good but who know, first CD I ever was in back in 2009
Been bullied for years but now I'm fine
No need to panic, here some wine
Don't get pissed too much
You may find a idiot wanting to touch
You may find yourself on a pavement unconscious or dead, on punchlines or in your bed
This world is evil so you may be found dead maybe a bullet through your head
Don't take no for an answer
You might find yourself with an ugly dog private dancer
[Chorus]
I'm ready for this
A fight to fight
I'm not losing
I'm here and always will be yo... for eternal
[Verse 5]
Eternal, eternal
Eternity in Hell to suffer a prostitute gay
You see, what you say
Rap a rhyme in time, time to commit this devilish crime
Drop a bomb, I just sold drugs to your mum
It's legal highs
She may dies or cries in a lonely light with no kinky ties
She needs a whip to self whip herself
She needs a fuck in the ass
Too busy getting shrizz on the ray and forgot to buy gas
You need a pass
A pass to go out the corridor
Fuckin' a bitch whore
Breakin' down the mother fuckin' door
It's the police
Open the door, please because I need your help
My house is on fire
Deal with it yourself because I'm helping the empire so fuck yer ass
Yo fuck yerself with a dildo, suffer for eternal

I'm ready for this
A fight to fight
I'm not losing
I'm here and always will be yo... for eternal

Better watch what eternal you go to because eternal means forever and so if you choose suffering then your doomed"

How come we don't say ""I love you"" enough?
'Til it's too late
It's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?
[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking it
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh"

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
[Pre-Chorus]
And now
When all is done, there is nothin' to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them
[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible"

Pode não significar nada pra vocês
Mas entendam, nada foi feito por mim
Então, eu não pretendo parar de forma alguma
Eu quero essa merda pra sempre, mano, sempre, mano, sempre, mano
Eu tô comprando tudo no shopping
E falando pra toda garota que ela é a única pra mim
E eu nem tô planejando ligar
Eu quero essa merda pra sempre, mano, sempre, mano, sempre, mano
[Verso 1: Drake]
Sobrenome Todos, primeiro nome Melhor
Tipo uma torção no tornozelo, garoto, eu não tô de brincadeira
Comecei localmеnte, mas graças a todos os haters
Eu conheço os pilotos do G-IV pеlo primeiro nome
Na sua cidade, bêbado com o marrom, Nino
Ela insiste que tem mais classe, nós sabemos
Nadando no dinheiro, venha e me encontre, Nemo
Se eu estive no clube, você sabe que eu me diverti, quimio
Lancei a mixtape, aquela merda parecia um álbum
Quem teria pensado que uma turnê pelo país seria o resultado?
As gravadoras querem meu nome ao lado de um X, igual o Malcolm
Todo mundo tem um acordo, eu fiz isso sem um
Yeah, mano, eu comando meu negócio
Tô matando todos esses rappers, você poderia jurar que eu tinha uma lista de sucesso
Todos que duvidaram de mim estão pedindo perdão
Se você não fez parte disso, pelo menos você teve que testemunhar, vadias"

2010,74,Already Gone,Kelly Clarkson,https://genius.com/Kelly-clarkson-already-gone-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die
[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop
[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
[Verse 2]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know that I love you so, I
Love you enough to let you go
[Chorus]
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
[Post-Chorus]
I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone
[Bridge]
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone (Ooh, oh)
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah
[Verse 3]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye"

2010,76,Secrets,OneRepublic,https://genius.com/Onerepublic-secrets-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so
[Chorus]
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
[Verse 2]
My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no"
2010,77,Naturally,Selena Gomez & the Scene,https://genius.com/Selena-gomez-and-the-scene-naturally-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell it comes naturally
It comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally
Mm, it comes naturally
[Pre-Chorus]
And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally
[Chorus]
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
[Verse 2]
You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (You know it does)
It comes naturally (Mmm, yeah)"
2010,78,Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready),Alicia Keys,https://genius.com/Alicia-keys-un-thinkable-im-ready-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)
(You ready)
[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
[Chorus]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
""This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?""
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)"

Whenever you're around

Well, can you feel this magic in the air?

Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale"

2010,86,Sweet Dreams,Beyoncé,https://genius.com/Beyonce-sweet-dreams-lyrics,"[Intro]
Turn the lights on
[Verse 1]
Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
[Chorus]
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you 
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true 
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you 
(Turn the lights on)"
2010,87,Use Somebody,Kings of Leon,https://genius.com/Kings-of-leon-use-somebody-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
[Chorus]
Someone like you
[Verse 2]
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice
[Chorus]
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody
[Bridge]
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out
Don't let it out"
2010,88,Undo It,Carrie Underwood,https://genius.com/Carrie-underwood-undo-it-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face
[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na"

Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla, if, if
If she holla, let her go

She's indecisive, she can't decide
She keeps on lookin' from left to right
Girl, come a bit closer, look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong, I'm Mr. Right
[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone
[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryna rewind, 'wind, 'wind, 'wind, 'wind
I wish our hearts could 
come together as one

2010,91,The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert,https://genius.com/Miranda-lambert-the-house-that-built-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I know they say, ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me
[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream"
2010,92,If I Die Young,The Band Perry,https://genius.com/The-band-perry-if-i-die-young-lyrics,"[Intro]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
[Refrain]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time"
2010,93,The Only Exception,Paramore,https://genius.com/Paramore-the-only-exception-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When I was younger, I saw
My daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
[Chorus]
But, darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere
Deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn
To myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk"
2010,94,American Honey,Lady Antebellum,https://genius.com/Lady-a-american-honey-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good, she grew up slow
Like American honey
[Verse 2]
Steady as a preacher, free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin', but wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey
[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
[Verse 3]
Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yeah
[Chorus]
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey"

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time
And try to not waste any more of mine
Get outta here fast
[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone, just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'
[Chorus]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you
[Verse 2]
Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you"
2010,97,Smile,Uncle Kracker,https://genius.com/Uncle-kracker-smile-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow, that's right
Completely unaware, nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay, yeah, it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade
[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
[Verse 2]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that"

Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it
[Verse 1]
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
[Pre-Chorus]
And all the time, you were tellin' me lies (Hey)

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, own me, nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me?
Need me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky, I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you
Right 'til the end (Oh)"

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag

Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?

Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

It's pretty accurate, if you say I'm the opposite of immaculate

and my flow is masculine
Your flow is busted like ejaculate
I'm like a crappy Christmas
I'm always rapping shit
And I'm more messed up than a glitch
Sean is my only Ohana, watch Lilo and Stitch
What's the point of having bars if you can't share it
People are so ignorant, what's the point of having money if you aren't rich
In mind and spirit
Flow got drive like I need the second gear bitch
Lost in the game like Nemo
Tryna forget you like Celo
But my green will be fatter than he though
My feelings can't be understood like Migos
Skin more black than Emo
Flow more sick then Chemo
Heart weighs a kilo
Wishing money was in my genes
But I have chinos
 
Storming on y'all like my name is El Nino
  
In the game like Nintendo or a Casino
I be taking a chance by chilling in my Sweatpants like Gambino
Fly like Rio

taking the game like repo
Spitting the acid like amino
This game is my home like depot
There's tools and screws

I like the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime, why you lookin' lonely?
Go buy another round and it's all on me
As long as I'm around, put it down on me
Just put it down on me, put it down on me
Down-down on me, put it down on me
Don't throw it off the mound, show me how it's 'gon be
Girl all I really want is you down on me (
Put it down on me

Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah
[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, 
couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there

It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (
Ayy

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, ah, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me
What there's to complain about"

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants

Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes

Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster 'cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
'Cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit; people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, 'cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I'm 6'8"""

Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile
[Verse 2]
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow
[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight
[Verse 3]
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real
No, it's never felt so right"

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing"

All I want to do is sit back
And watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

Long hair she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow-bone

So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Flood warning, Flocka yea
Blowin' fuck it I dont care
Dreads is flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like bruh
I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks
Oh fuckin' well

With 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow

Hey you got me in a trance

Pussy pop on her handstand

Un-un-uncontrollably

To keep both my hands above the blanket

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

2011,50,Moment 4 Life,Nicki Minaj featuring Drake,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

2011,51,I Need a Doctor,Dr. Dre featuring Eminem and Skylar Grey,https://genius.com/Kyle-mcgovern-all-289-eminem-songs-ranked-lyrics,"Fifteen years ago, the American public was introduced to Marshall Mathers, Eminem, and Slim Shady,
 
a triptych of manic personalities whose interests included raising hell, making enemies, and sticking nine-inch nails through each one of their eyelids.
 
To commemorate Shady being set loose upon the world, we've decided to rank every single song Em has released to date
But first, allow us to qualify our countdown with a few rules of eligibility:
 
We only included songs that were given an official retail release — that means tracks featured on studio albums, EPs, and compilations, plus guest verses; we didn't consult mixtapes or unofficial freestyles
, 
so we offer our deepest apologies to ""Nail in the Coffin,"" ""Til Hell Freezes Over,"" and other noteworthy rarities.
 
Skits weren't considered, either
 (condolences to all the 
Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman
 die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the 
live Grammy performance of ""Stan""
 or 
The Slim Shady EP's ""Just the Two of Us.""
 And with that, we begin the 
Eminem show...

There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (
Fly, fly, fly, fly

Up, up here we go, go, up, up here we go, go
Let's fly (
Fly, fly, fly, fly

Up, up here we go, go, where we stop nobody knows, knows"

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university"
2011,60,Hold It Against Me,Britney Spears,https://genius.com/Britney-spears-hold-it-against-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight"
2011,61,More,Usher,https://genius.com/Usher-more-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor
[Bridge]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up
[Chorus]
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
[Verse 2]
Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that"

You say that I'm messin' with your head

Love hurts, whether it's right or wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't stop 'cause I'm havin' too much fun
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
You're on your knees, begging, ""Please stay with me""
But, honestly, I just need to be a little crazy
[Chorus]
All my life, I've been good, but now
I'm thinking, ""What the hell?""
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life, I've been good, but now
Woah, what the hell?
[Post-Chorus]
What?
What?
What? What the hell?"

Tinie Tempah

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
A 
message to the main
, (oh)
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way (
Let's go!
)
[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you're listenin' now
They say they ain't heard nothin' like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man, I'm like a young gun, fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I'm bringin' gravity back
Adopted by the major
, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?), Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screamin' 'til they hear you out"

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line

How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by

Drinking old cheap bottles of wine

A little sideways, yeah maybe

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously"

Uh, uh, uh, uh, ah
Uh, uh, uh
Now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now what's your name?
[Verse 1]
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at 
my derrière
You can stare, but if you touch it, I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture (Hey)
Sweeter than a swisher (Hey)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya (Hey)
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby, you can see it (See it)
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it (Ow)
[Verse 2]
My name is Keri (Hey), I'm so very (Hey)
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary (Hey)
Boys wanna marry (Hey), looking at my derrière (Hey)
You can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture (Picture)
Sweeter than a swisher
 (Swisher)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me"

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm 
back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, ""Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,""
There's...
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & 
Robert John Lange
]
(
Something
) Something about this place
(
Something
) Something, 'bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(
Something
) Something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me ""Heart of Gold""
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you, oh-oh"

Uten deg, uten deg

Jeg kan ikke hvile meg, jeg kan ikke kjempe meg
Alt jeg trenger er du og jeg

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'

This is real, so take a chance

Edge of the water; we were feeling alright

Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down

In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me

Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song"

Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl, aww

Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around"
2011,96,Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not,Thompson Square,https://genius.com/Thompson-square-are-you-gonna-kiss-me-or-not-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Keifer]
We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
[Verse 2: Keifer]
Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?
[Verse 3: Keifer]
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
[Verse 4: Keifer]
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me"
2011,97,Animal,Neon Trees,https://genius.com/Neon-trees-animal-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, I want some more
Oh-oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh-oh, I want some more
Oh-oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you"
2011,98,You and Tequila,Kenny Chesney featuring Grace Potter,https://genius.com/Kenny-chesney-you-and-tequila-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hellbent on getting high
High above the lights of town
[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
[Verse 2]
Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
There were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again
[Chorus]
You and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough"
2011,99,Colder Weather,Zac Brown Band,https://genius.com/Zac-brown-band-colder-weather-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane
[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
[Verse 2]
At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him
[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'"
2011,100,My Last,Big Sean featuring Chris Brown,https://genius.com/Nvp-summer-playlist-2015-annotated,"Finding good music can be a challenge.
 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

2012,1,Somebody That I Used to Know,Gotye featuring Kimbra,https://genius.com/Genius-farsi-translations-somebody-that-i-used-to-know-by-gotyekimbra-lyrics,"Now and then I think of when we were together
بعضی وقت ها به زمانی که باهم بودیم فکر میکنم
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
مثل وقتی که میگفتی ممکنه از فرط خوشحالی بمیری
Told myself that you were right for me
به خودم میگفتم که تو برای من بهترینی (مناسب ترین انتخاب برای من هستی)
But felt so lonely in your company
اما کنارت احساس  تنهایی میکردم
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
اما اون عشق بود و این یک درد که هنوز به یاد میارم
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
تو میتونی به یک نوع خاصی از ناراحتی اعتیاد پیدا کنی
Like resignation to the end, always the end
مثل وقتی که آدم تسلیم میشه تو زندگی وقتی میدونی تهش پایانه و مرگه
So when we found that we could not make sense
پس وقتی که فهمیدیم ما به درد هم نمیخوریم
Well, you said that we would still be friends
خب، تو گفتی که ما میتونیم همچنان دوست بمونیم
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
اما من اعتراف میکنم از اینکه همه چی بینمون تموم شد، خوشحال بودم
But you didn't have to cut me off
ولی تو مجبور نبودی منو از زندگیت حذف کنی
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
انگاری که هیچ وقت اتفاقی نیوفتاده و ما هیچی نبودیم
And I don't even need your love
و من حتی احتیاجی به عشق تو ندارم
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
اما تو با من مثل یک غریبه رفتار میکنی که این حس خیلی بدیه"
2012,2,Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,https://genius.com/Carly-rae-jepsen-call-me-maybe-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't lookin' for this
But now you're in my way
[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're goin', baby?
[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe"

2012,5,Lights,Ellie Goulding,https://genius.com/Ellie-goulding-lights-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
[Chorus]
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)
[Verse 2]
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe"

And all that counts is here and now

I'm glad you came
[Verse 1: Nathan Sykes]
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
[Pre-Chorus: Tom Parker]
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came"

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)
[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong
[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone"

Let's go to the beach-each, let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches like me is hard to come by
The Patrón own, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh

I'm on the floor, floor, I love to dance
So give me more, more 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor like it's your last chance
If you want more, more, then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky (
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time (

Hands up and touch the sky (

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

To prove I'm right, I put it in a song

If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo
Number one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder when we hit fame
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough
I hear you like the wild stuff
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh

Saddle me up and let's begin

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

I'll be there for you

Hefty bag to hold my love

Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you

2012,20,The Motto,Drake featuring Lil Wayne,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered
100. ""All of the Lights"" - Kanye West

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know,
 
we know
They won't get you like I will,
 
my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow

You won't ever have to hide

How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us

No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door

There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', ""There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds

Tie a knot in the rope

But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us

Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse

The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we are, so close
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest?
[Chorus]
Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
[Post-Chorus]
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home
Alone, there were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone
My love, but you did not reply"

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse"

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

We were born and raised in a summer haze

Getting drunk off the thought of you naked

But you're so magnetic, magnetic

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

Well, anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I kiss your lips
I, I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever

As good as you make me feel (Make me feel)
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales (Than your fairy tales)
Better than your best dreams (Your best dreams)
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I, I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drives in a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started
[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
[Verse 2]
If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty
[Chorus]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime"

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire

Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started
[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night

See, I've been waitin' all day

Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize
[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (Not over you)
[Verse 2]
Damn, damn, girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you"

Or is it just a one-night stand?”

Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right

On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'

2012,95,Hard to Love,Lee Brice,https://genius.com/Lee-brice-hard-to-love-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me
[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
[Verse 2]
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you
[Chorus]
I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good
[Bridge]
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man"

There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
[Verse 2]
And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck"

2012,98,Fly Over States,Jason Aldean,https://genius.com/Jason-aldean-fly-over-states-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma
[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states
[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat"

Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
[Verse 2]
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night
[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure"

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know"

Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled

And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

2013,8,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-when-i-was-your-man-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
[Chorus]
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
[Verse 2]
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes"
2013,9,Cruise,Florida Georgia Line featuring Nelly,https://genius.com/Mr-varnell-turn-up-for-hick-hop-annotated,"""The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake""
So says country superstar duo Florida Georgia Line in their smash single from the spring of 2014, 
“This Is How We Roll.”
  This is not just an empty boast, either.  Listen to the second verse while perhaps imagining Drake as a white, Southern, 
bro-country artist
:
""Up on them 37 Nittos,
 
windows tinted hard to see though [...]
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though""
Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy – 
extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle
 - but the way he rhymes “though” using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession, why, it even 
sounds
 like Drake!
On another track, 
their “Cruise Remix” video featuring Nelly
, Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre-blending.  While some rap music has long been short-sightedly 
accused of focusing on cash, cars, drugs, and women
, FGL show that this is 
redneck
 thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames:
Likewise, through artful alliteration, the boys name-drop their party drink as well:
""She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker""
And this is all before we get to 
Nelly’s impassioned verse
, which he contributes, according to the video’s opening scene, to help them learn how to “turn up.”
Judging by “This Is How We Roll” as a follow-up, it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well –- so well that they have been influenced 
even by the structure of Hip-Hop, bringing in one of 
their
 homies
 for a 
guest verse
: Luke Bryan, himself known to get turnt 
by mixing a little Conway with some T-Pain every once in a while.
Some people, though, are instead turning this trend down.
 While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7/17/14), the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants.  
One such comment puts it this way: “Hick-Hop. Manufactured, lame, corporate horse crap. This is a disgrace to country music. Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now.”
Really?
The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!
  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like:
""I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down""
""When I was arrested I was dressed in black""
""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die""
We’re talking the “Man In Black” himself!
I think he’d welcome the chance, were he still alive, to pal around with some 
new school gangsters
, and, 
presented with an opportunity for a remix
, would probably choose to 
turn up
 instead of 
turn it down!"

Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—
[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga"

محبوب میں اکیلا ہوں یہاں
میری محبوب میں اکیلا ہوں یہاں
‎اے، اے، اے، اے
[Chorus]
When you're ready, come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
When you're ready, when you're ready
When you're ready, come and get it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sitting right here real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waiting standby
Can't stop, because I love it
Hate the way I love you
All day, all night
Maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not too shy to show I love you
I got no regrets
I love you much too much to hide you
This love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet
So baby, whenever you're ready"

Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake
I will have to slip away
[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh
[Verse 2]
Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright

You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath

2013,43,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis featuring Mary Lambert,https://genius.com/Velyn-analyzing-same-love-persuasive-techniques-lyrics,"As it nears the end of 2015’s LGBT Pride Month, it felt most appropriate to analyze 
“Same Love”
 Macklemore, Ryan Lewis, and Mary Lambert’s Pro-LGBT anthem. This song was written as an advocacy piece for Washington Referendum 74 (which passed in 2012) but ended up reverberating across the world
Although there are a variety of factors which optimized this trio's ability to influence political and social discourse to such an extent, rhetoric was by far the most pervasive. These techniques created a persuasive case for its listeners. Central to understanding its appeal is noting that this song does not function as a formal argument, rather it is best explained in a 
sermonic form
, which is established by the lyrics first six words
“When I was in the 3rd grade""
 sets the tone of the song by creating a testimony of experience. This helps ease the listener insofar as Macklemore is merely recounting an anecdote at this point, rather than offering an opinion on such a contentious issue. As such, this testimony derives from the use of a witness (the rapper himself)
This use of testimony from witness derives from Aristotle who identified two types of witnesses: Ancient  and Immediate
These forms of witnesses can be found in Aristotle’s “Rhetoric” Book 1, Chapter 15. Ancient witnesses are defined as those “whose judgement is known to all”; such as poets and philosophers. Ancient witnesses derive from literature that has long held regard. They are the most authoritative witnesses and may only be taken as evidence for broad generalizations as they do not have context for present situations
Immediate witnesses are contemporary peers who “are well-known people who have expressed their opinions about some disputed matter.” They may be broken down into personal (those who directly witnessed an event) or those who are merely well regarded. Personal witnesses may offer direct testimony to specific incidents but are easily suspected of prejudice. Well-regarded persons carry the authority of that regard, but may not testify regarding specific tasks
“Same Love” blends 
personal witness 
,  
well-regarded witness
 and 
ancient witness 
. The use of historic references here creates a sense of martyrdom, by intrinsically connecting successful social movements  (such as civil rights) with gay rights, a sense of justice is instilled and moral grounds for an argument are established. This creates a ""Christ-like"" figure in the victims of LGBT discrimination, as these individuals are being scapegoated for the ills of society and victimized; much in the manner that Christ was sacrificed for humanity's sins, while He himself being infallible
This blend diminishes the perceived weaknesses of specific witnesses. The power of testimony is that it serves as enthymematic evidence. In an enthymeme, we assume that the audience will supply presumptions, values, and perceptions. In testimony, the audience supplements the assertion by supplying rationale from their own experience; that is, their personal narratives only strengthen Macklemore’s story
This is why the continued references to technology are so effective. 
“Youtube comments”
, and 
“message boards”
 equalize our experiences. It is a safe assumption that the audience hearing this song have at some point used derogatory language, or seen it used by others, on the internet. While we may not discuss this issue in public, its mention will elicit a 
hesitant nod from its listeners
The dichotomies formed in these lyrics create a powerful influence, drawing purposeful contradictions between those who are 
“playing God”
 and the capacity to which 
“God loves”.
 To further scathingly taunt those who hide behind the pretense of following God’s word, the writers assert that this interpretation is false doctrine stating that 
“When I was in church they taught me something else, if you preach hate at the service, those words aren’t anointed.”
The power of this song resides in the force of its testimony. As audience members find similar experience in their own stories, they can feel the force of the testimony narratives given by the authors. The form, from testimony to moral demand to biblical proof-text, carries the rhetorical resonance of sermon. Sermons typically build on text (maxims) and testimony (examples) to create rhetorically powerful visions and effective moral demands for their audience
“Same Love” works effectively as a message to those who can identity with the narratives that ground it; giving a mighty voice, while others are 
“comfortable in remaining voiceless”.
 More broadly, “Same Love” creates a forceful message in a culture that has historically placed value in sermonic form. Hence, controversy, rather than distracting from the popular form of the song, actually enhances the songs cultural force as an anthem, persuading us to see all love, as the same love"

2013,50,Heart Attack,Demi Lovato,https://genius.com/Demi-lovato-heart-attack-lyrics,"[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball
[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand
[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love (Love)
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack"
2013,51,Love Somebody,Maroon 5,https://genius.com/Maroon-5-love-somebody-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I know your insides are feeling so hollow (Ooh)
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same
[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
[Verse 2]
You're such a hard act for me to follow (Ooh)
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same"
2013,52,I Will Wait,Mumford & Sons,https://genius.com/Mumford-and-sons-i-will-wait-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Well, I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
[Refrain]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
[Chorus]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way, shake the excess"
2013,53,Try,Pink,https://genius.com/P-nk-try-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why
[Chorus]
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try
[Bridge]
Eh, eh, eh
[Verse 2]
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it's not right
[Chorus]
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try"
2013,54,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,https://genius.com/Darius-rucker-wagon-wheel-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me
[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
[Chorus]
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Yeah, rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me"

[Intro]
오빤 강남 스타일
강남 스타일
[Verse 1]
낮에는 따사로운 인간적인 여자
커피 한잔의 여유를 아는 품격 있는 여자
밤이 오면 심장이 뜨거워지는 여자
그런 반전 있는 여자
[Refrain]
나는 사나이
낮에는 너만큼 따사로운 그런 사나이
커피 식기도 전에 원샷 때리는 사나이
밤이 오면 심장이 터져 버리는 사나이
그런 사나이
[Pre-Chorus]
아름다워, 사랑스러워
그래, 너 (Hey), 그래, 바로 너 (Hey)
아름다워, 사랑스러워
그래, 너 (Hey), 그래, 바로 너 (Hey)
지금부터 갈 데까지 가볼까?"

2013,58,Some Nights,Fun,https://genius.com/Fun-some-nights-lyrics,"[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore
[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style"

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

And I will do it for you, for you

Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined"

Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life

Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
, 
lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
 
I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play 
Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it"
2013,80,Sure Be Cool If You Did,Blake Shelton,https://genius.com/Blake-shelton-sure-be-cool-if-you-did-lyrics,"[Click here to read Blake’s story behind “Sure Be Cool If You Did”]
[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon
 
looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all
[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your 
pretty pink lemonade shooter
 and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
 and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did
[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do
[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did"

Eres una problemática, eres una problemática
Huh, no eres nada más que una problemática, chica
[Verse 1]
Me volviste a enganchar desde el minuto que te sentaste
La forma en la que mordías tu labio hizo que mi cabeza duera vueltas
Después de un trago o dos, fui masilla en tus manos
No sé si tendré la fuerza para pararme (Oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Proble-problemática, yeah, ese es tu segundo nombre (Oh-oh)
Sé que no eres buеna, pero estás atrapada en mi cеrebro
Y quiero saber
[Chorus]
¿Por qué se siente tan bien pero duele tanto? (Woah)
Mi mente sigue diciendo, ""Corre tan rápido como puedas""
Digo que ya estuvo, pero luego me tiras hacia atrás (Woah)
Juro que me estás dando un ataque al corazón
Problemática
[Verse 2]
Es como si siempre estuvieras ahí en las esquinas de mi mente
Veo una silueta cada vez que cierro los ojos
Debe haber veneno en esas yemas de los dedos tuyos
Porque sigo regresando otra vez por más (Oh-oh)"

Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl, let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you and all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl, let me help

Until you learn to love yourself

2013,88,Next to Me,Emeli Sandé,https://genius.com/Emeli-sande-next-to-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out till three
You won't ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
[Chorus]
Next to me, ooh-ooh
Next to me, ooh-ooh
Next to me, ooh-ooh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
[Verse 2]
When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me"
2013,89,Mama's Broken Heart,Miranda Lambert,https://genius.com/Miranda-lambert-mamas-broken-heart-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop
[Verse 2]
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
[Chorus]
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
[Verse 3]
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame
[Verse 4]
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (
Ah
)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (
Ah
)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face"

Hey, girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head
Since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah, girl, you make me wanna write a song
[Chorus]
And it goes like, ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like, hey, girl, I'm blown away
But, yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all-night-long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this
[Verse 2]
Hey, girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone
I don't know what it is about you, baby
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song
[Chorus]
And it goes like, ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like, hey, girl, I'm blown away
But, yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all-night-long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this"

Somos os melhores nessa porra, mano
Ace Hood
Super, Future
[Refrão: Future]
Eu vim te procurar com os Haitianos
Eu continuo fumando um Jamaicano do bom
Eu transo com vadias de diferentes raças
Você ganha o dinheiro, eles começaram a odiar
(Aumenta!)
Eu acordei em um Bugatti novo
Eu acordei em um Bugatti novo
Eu acordei em um Bugatti novo
Eu acordei em um Bugatti novo
Eu acordei em um Bugatti novo
[Verso 1: Ace Hood]
Okay, os caras estão odiando, eu tô rico pra caralho
100K, eu gastei isso no meu pulso
200 dólares, eu gastei isso com a sua vadia
Me faça um modelo, coloquei isso na minha lista
Oh, lá vai ele naquele estrangеiro de novo
Tô matando a cena, tragam o legista
O assassinato quе ela escreveu, engula ou engasgue
Transo com ela e vou pra casa, eu não vou ligar pra ela de novo
Acordei cedinho, casa do tamanho de uma faculdade
Fumo meio quilo da maconha mais forte
Dirigindo um carro sem quilometragem
Os diamantes custaram uma fortuna
Os cavalos estão todos dentro dos Porsches
Esses cuzões mal conseguem pagar por isso
4.200, minha hipoteca
Brilhando pra esses caras igual o Kobe
Foda-se todos esses haters, vocês me aborrecem
Só os reais ganham um pedaço do prato
Tô representando a minha cidade, tô mandando no meu estado
Me dê uma pistola e depois corro com os quilos
Os caras querem treta, depois eu visito a sua casa (Bang!)"

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you

Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

Well, anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I, I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel (Make me feel)
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales (Than your fairy tales)
Better than your best dreams (Your best dreams)
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips

Wanna hold your hand forever

Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while
[Chorus]
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore
[Verse 2]
I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not"

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop, girl, you know I love it when you

Get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby, get your shine on, shine on
Baby, get your shine on

Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some 
Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rockin' all night long

Turn your party lights on

2013,95,#thatPower,will.i.am featuring Justin Bieber,https://genius.com/Hip-hop-dx-hip-hop-songs-that-will-be-your-motivation-lyrics,"To help celebrate summer Pepsi compiled a list of the 
'Seven Hip Hop Songs That Will Be Your Motivation'
. One song that was included by Pepsi was Snoop Lion’s 'Let The Bass Go'. The track is featured in the new Dream Works picture Turbo. The artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg plays a snail in the upcoming animated film. Snoop made the name change to coincide with the release of his reggae album, 
'Reincarnated'
, which came out earlier this year. The Long Beach, California native is also set to headline 
Fun Fun Fun Fest
 this fall
Another track included on Pepsi's list was Daft Punk’s 'Lose Yourself To Dance', which features Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers. Both Daft Punk and Pharrell have played major roles in the some of the biggest album releases of the year. The French electronic band produced four tracks on Kanye West’s 'Yeezus', while the Neptunes beatmaker added his musical talents to Jay-Z’s 'Magna Carta Holy Grail'
Pepsi also included Lecrae’s 'Mayday', which includes a guest appearance from Big K.R.I.T. and Ashton Jones, on its list. 
Lecrae’s music was also featured in another list put together by the soft drink company that detailed 'The Songs You Have To Hear Right Now
'. The Houston native made history this year when he became the first rapper to win the Best Gospel Album category.
The other songs on the list were William's '#That Power' featuring Justin Bieber, Mali Music's 'Ready Aim', Fergie's 'A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)' and Jennifer Lopez's 'Live It Up' featuring Pitbull
The complete list can be viewed via Pepsi's website"

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Post-Chorus]
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go"

Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you
[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever"

To flourish through darkness and enter your complexity
Aching as flowers refused
Then you loose grip on emotions;
With sadness we're doomed
The frost is inside you killing you through
Burning your heart in the name of truth
In fear, we sear
Again in tears
Recall the years when fights appeared
Remember dear, those lonely years
You turn, with fear, to not see me crying here

Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door

Makes everything seem small

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?
[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night
[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst, down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
[Post-Chorus]
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following"
2014,30,Loyal,Chris Brown featuring Lil Wayne and French Montana or Too Short or Tyga,https://genius.com/Rap-critic-rap-critic-reviews-loyal-by-chris-brown-feat-lil-wayne-and-tyga-lyrics,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's stop talking about Chris Brown.
 
Let's talk about someone else, anyone else!
 What's top 5 on the Rap charts?
*Pitbulll*
STILL!?
*""Show Me""*
Already reviewed that
*""Monster""*
No, I need to lay off Eminem for a while
. Who else?
*""My Nigga my nigga, my nigga my nigga""*
Hm…
*""Stoner""*
…as soon as I figure out what he's saying, I'll get back to you…
Wow, man. Nothing good to review on the Rap Charts! Well, what's on the pop charts that has featured rappers on it? *""Chris Brown* *sigh* Okay, fine, I'll talk about… this song, from Chris Brown. Okay, let's have a listen…
""You thought it was over?""
I kinda hoped…
I know these hoes ain't right
When a rich nigga want you, and your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal…
Wait, didn't I JUST review a song about women cheating on their boyfriends? *""What's Love""* Yeah, not JUST a song about having sex with a girl, or just a couple of one-off lines about someone isn't faithful, no, that's not good enough. THE PREMISE OF THESE SONGS are SPECIFICALLY about taking someone else's lover
These hoes ain't loyal…
The thing is, this isn't like most songs nowadays that are so busy, you can ignore the lyrics. Here, he says the lyric, followed by 3 awkwardly long seconds of silence, and it directly draws your attention to his message. But hold up, maybe I'm just too stricken by the similarity of the last song to make a fair judgement of this one, maybe I should judge the song on it's own merit, and not directly compare it to another one that I didn't like. I should try to look at it with fresh eyes. Okay, my palette's cleansed. Alright, hit me, Chris Brown… oh, dammit…
I wasn't born last night
Oh wait, this song starts with a verse from Wayne, because… because of course it does…
I wasn't born last night, I know these hoes ain't right
I think women are evil! But oddly enough, they're my biggest fan base. Life is stupid like that…
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night
…A quick service announcement to all men out there: if you just recently found out that you've been cheated on, for the love of God, do NOT turn to the hiphop station on your radio"

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money,
 dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind

Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you

Boom clap, you make me feel good

Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good

Send ""Lost In Your Complexity"" Ringtone to Mobile I'd give you the soul of this boy that is in front of you
His useless life isn't enough to beseech all your love
As you put sight in this poor boy that is ready with fear
To flourish through darkness and enter your complexity
Aching as flowers refused
Then you loose grip on emotions;
With sadness we're doomed
The frost is inside you killing you through
Burning your heart in the name of truth
In fear, we sear
Again in tears
Recall the years when fights appeared
Remember dear, those lonely years
You turn, with fear, to not see me crying here
Why? Why does your sun shine this way?
Say no more, cast me to die just today
Fighting within
Our quest tastes like an open wound
Now that's all over; this quest will never come through"

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
 (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag and I hit him with the jab like (Hey)

Je te regarde et ça me coupe la respiration
Quand tu me regardes mon cœur bat la chamade
(Ça me fait vibrer doucement le cœur)
Et en silence ton regard dit mille mots
La nuit pendant laquelle je te prie pour que le soleil ne se
Lève pas
(En dansant, en dansant, en dansant, en dansant)
Ton corps et le mien remplissant le vide
En montant et descendant (en montant et descendant)
(En dansant, en dansant, en dansant, en dansant)
Ce feu à l’intérieur de moi m'affole
Me sature
Avec ton physique et ton alchimie aussi ton anatomie
La bière et la tequila et ta bouche avec la mienne
Je n'en peux plus, (je n'en peux plus)
Je n'en peux plus, (je n'en peux plus)
Avec cette mélodie, ta couleur, ton imagination
Avec ta philosophie, ma tête est vide
Je n'en peux plus, (je n'en peux plus)
Je n'en peux plus, (je n'en peux plus)
Je veux être avec toi, vivre avec toi
Danser avec toi, avoir avec toi
Une nuit folle (Une nuit folle)
Oh embrasser ta bouche (et embrasser ta bouche)
Je veux être avec toi, vivre avec toi
Danser avec toi, avoir avec toi une nuit folle
Je veux être avec toi
Terriblement folle
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)"

We
We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
[Chorus]
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn"

2014,43,Show Me,Kid Ink featuring Chris Brown,https://genius.com/Nvp-summer-playlist-2015-annotated,"Finding good music can be a challenge.
 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
[Verse 2]
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you"

Said, all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday? Uh
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start
[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleedin'
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it
[Chorus]
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now, how about I'll be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every mornin', I just wanna see you starin' back at me (Starin' back at me)

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

I believe every lie that I ever told
Paid for every heart that I ever stole
I played my cards and I didn't fold
Well it ain't that hard when you got soul

Somewhere I heard that life is a test
I been through the worst but still, I give my best
God made my mold different from the rest
Then he broke that mold so I know I’m blessed

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"

I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Say it makes you feel like an angel

Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Verse 2]
I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up"

2014,66,Dirt,Florida Georgia Line,https://genius.com/Florida-georgia-line-dirt-lyrics,"[Intro: Music Video Only]
I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day
[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...
[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
[Music Video Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay"
2014,67,Love Runs Out,OneRepublic,https://genius.com/Onerepublic-love-runs-out-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black, that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
[Verse 2]
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
Woo, I'll be running, woo, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
[Verse 3]
There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles
But Mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said, ""Do what you want, say prayers at night""
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out, yeah"
2014,68,Bottoms Up,Brantley Gilbert,https://genius.com/Brantley-gilbert-bottoms-up-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going 95, burning down 129, yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's riding shotgun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing, right
Pull into the party like ""Y'all wassup?""
[Chorus]
Tonight is bottoms up, up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town, get up
Drop a tailgate on your truck
Find a keg and fill your cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at you like that
Make you wanna slide on in like ""Girl, what's up?""
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up
Tonight is bottoms up (Up, up)
Get 'em up
[Verse 2]
Damn, girl, I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
And she's doing it in Daisy Dukes, girl
She's got you tapping on your boy's shoulder
""Hey dog, check this out""
And that's how them girls do it in the Dirty South, yeah
She'll have you on your knee ""Can I marry you?""
Yeah"

I don't know, it's just something about ya (Woo)
Got me feelin' like I can't be without ya (Woo)
Anytime someone mention your name (Woo)
I be feelin' as if I'm around ya (Woo)
Ain't no words to describe you, baby (Woo)
All I know is that you take me high (Woo)
Can you tell that you drive me crazy? (Woo)
'Cause I can't get you out my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why
[Chorus]
You light me up inside
Like the Fourth of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well, you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower (Shower)"

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart, yeah
[Verse 1]
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and then some
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I tried to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say
[Chorus]
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart (Ah)"

Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top
Jack in her Cherry Coke town
Momma and Daddy put their roots right here
‘Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn school bus kickin’ up red dust
Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA
, no A/C in the vents
[Chorus]
We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, 
faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin’, front seat leanin’
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin’ up in little pink houses
Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright
[Verse 2]
Baptist church parkin’ lot, tryin’ not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light"
2014,74,Brave,Sara Bareilles,https://genius.com/Sara-bareilles-brave-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave"

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour"

They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired
[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again? (Woo-hoo)
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
But we can leave the night on (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight

I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
 
rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake

Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

Chase that disco ball around

Are you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

Luke

I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around

It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long"

 native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - 
even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem
!

52. Run The Jewels ""Banana Clipper""
51. YG ""My Nigga""
50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”
Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from 
“Summer Knights”
,
 Joey drops some surprises; 
explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal
 and that he does verses for free!
49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)” ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q
48. Tyler, the Creator “Answer”
47. Joey Badass “'95 'Till Infinity”
46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”
45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer
 Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original 
“I Shot U Down”.
 Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.
44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY!
 
42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson
41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean
40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick Lamar
Another collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""
Born Sinner
"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!
39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross
38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”
37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean
36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross
35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell Williams
This is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. 
Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO!
 The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that 
video
 and this became undeniably next-level. 
34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”
33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC
32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain”
 
30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”
Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. 
Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” 
literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.
29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt
28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino
27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push”
 
25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”
The first single off Acid Rap, 
Juice
 was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to 
(some jumping around is mandatory).
 But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s 
dope
 bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, 
you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit.
 What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.
24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan
23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky
22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”
21. Eminem “Berzerk""
20. Drake “Worst Behavior”
This 
Nothing Was The Sa
me
 stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more 
flexin’
 in his verses. 
DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample.
 Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- 
he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem.
 
The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his 
worst
 skit to date.
 
Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder
 and remind us of 
his 
Degrassi
 roots
, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”
19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey Veggies
The leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on 
Doris'
 standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. 
But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate,
 but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.
18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick Lamar
When the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, 
Love Game
 was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. 
But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible
. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (
cheesy sample included
), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous 
Sherane
. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be 
playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”
, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off 
Drake's 
Nothing Was The Same
 album.
 The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.
16. Childish Gambino “3005”
The lead single for 
Because the Internet
 is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and 
effortlessly
 here. 
Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & Twista
Two generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and 
re
-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that 
hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin Timberlake
In a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the 
world
, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. 
The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake
. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.
And what an entry it is. 
His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason.
 A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.
13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train""
 is the 
cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: 
was it the energized Danny Brown?
 
the lovable braggart Action Bronson?
 
the wordsmith Joey Bad?
 
the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.?
 Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is 
flames
12. Schoolboy Q “
Collard Greens
” Kendrick Lamar
A cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment'
s
 main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), 
before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable.
 The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.
11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”
When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like 
Stronger
. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. 
Kanye is pissed off
, 
but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants
 
or Jimmy Kimmel.
 No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and 
Yeezus
. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics
10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. Miguel
In classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. 
The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook,
 
but otherwise it is Cole’s world.
 
The incredibly catchy hooks
 match up perfectly with 
his production
 and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. 
This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams”
 is about not only a girl, but 
also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality.
 
And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love.
 The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!
09. Drake 
“Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2”
 ft. Jay Z
Drake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP 
Nothing Was The Same
. Boi-1da delivers on 
Pound Cake
 with a 
spacey Ellie Goulding sample
 as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.
The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for 
Paris Morton Music 2
 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s 
no longer the same
08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name
 is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover,
 “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. 
Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine
 with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks 
harder than him thumping the wall with his fist.
 The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.
07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to 
Yeezus
.
 The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? 
Who really cares?
 Kanye fans who hated 
Yeezus
 loved it and Kanye fans who loved 
Yeezus
 loved it. 
“Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song
 featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, 
topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?!
 Well, many would actually say “
the video
”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. 
But that was the point.
 
Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned.
 How very, 
New Slaves
 of him.
06. Eminem “Bad Guy”
Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every 
The Empire Strikes Back
, there are three 
Matrix Reloaded
s.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to 
his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,”
 fans were nervous.  
After all, Stan died at the end, right?
 
So what’s left
?
Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are 
“just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”
  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.
05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick Lamar
This genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. 
The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves
. 
Kings Push & Kendrick
 come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. 
While Terrence is neck deep in dealing
, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. 
“Nosetalgia”
 is 
your 8ball on a Friday night
, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the 
In N Out double double you crave in LA.
 It’s dope. 
04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves
 introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of 
Yeezus
: remorse. 
The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself
. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop 
the somber piano of the beautifully chopped 
Strange Fruit
 sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s 
R U Ready
 burst through
 and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. 
Blood On The Leaves
 got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to 
Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance
 the song is one of the most viewed 
Yeezus
 tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if 
Yeezus
 started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.
03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”
.
 After the novelty of a 
second Marshall Mathers LP
 began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the 
third MC this year to proclaim himself a god.
 This 
rapid-fire
 lyrical tour de force is laced with 
references to the first Mathers LP
, 
sneak disses to some of his old buddies
, 
and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words
. 
The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day 
""Rap God""
 was released,
 and has now amassed over 
4 million page views
Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. 
After criticism he lip synced on live television,
 
Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live.
 It’s safe to say 
""Rap God""
 proved the 
internal rhyme
 mastermind is back on his 
Pharoahe Monch grind
 and nothing’s going to stop him.
02. Big Sean 
“Control”
 ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay Electronica
You all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. 
Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps
 
and reminiscing on his grandfather
, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, 
while sneaking in TV
 
and car references
, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D.
 His name? 
King Kendrick Lamar
. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. 
The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring
 
and the King of New York
, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. 
And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!)
. Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01.
 
Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves""
 is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. 
Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew
, 
New Slaves
 is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. 
He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time”
 and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, 
and even America's prison system
, it’s hard to disagree
The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. 
With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world.
 It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of 
”New Slaves
 is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - 
would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first?
 His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. 
”New Slaves”
 invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.
— Kanye West"

[Verse 1: Drake]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it;
 
if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up (Lay up)
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits, 
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy (Ha-ha)
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season
 in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it (Arf!)
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself"

I’ll never settle down
That’s what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man
Just ask anyone
[Chorus]
I don’t dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don’t dance
[Verse 2]
Love’s never come my way
I’ve never been this far
Cause you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I don’t dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain’t my style, but I don’t care
I’d do anything with you anywhere
Yes, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
[Chorus: Miranda Lambert & Carrie Underwood]
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
[Verse 3: Carrie Underwood]
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory"

We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though

Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans, though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm

They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far

But I'm back inside a haze again
If I could always see this way
I'd be content every day
Bored forever
I didn't know what I had missed
Until I felt this gentleness
Let's sink into the easy life together
I don't feel at home in my life here anymore
Throwing up on the bed watch me
Silent on the door
I wokе up dreaming of a chain tied to my neck
Evеn when I'm sleeping there's a tendency towards threat
I wanna feel that haze again
You can't be satisfied with all my anger streaks
But I'd never act that way if you were here with me
Didn't know what I had missing
Until I felt this gentleness

Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Falling onto my knees

I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help

I'm startin' to think you want him, too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can I help it?
(
Jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm gettin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous
[Chorus]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous"

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now"

Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down, I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

I drive you insane
[Verse 1]
Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play letting my life get away
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done
[Chorus]
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
You know you like it, but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
Follow me 'cause you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
(What you want, what you gonna do?)"

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants"

I don't get no sleep, I don't get no peace

Lord knows I've tried, I can't get her off my mind

Two things I'm about it are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover

I need to be the one who takes you home

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

I got some models that you see up in the movies and they wanna make a flick for the camera (Yeah)
Wanna be Kim Kardashian (Hey), heard I was livin' like a bachelor (Woo)"
2015,71,Riptide,Vance Joy,https://genius.com/Vance-joy-riptide-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turnin' green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
And they come unstuck
[Chorus]
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
[Verse 2]
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's runnin' from himself
And she's been livin' on the highest shelf
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
And they come unstuck"

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand, woah
And then I let him go
Now there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK, hey-hey
Until I made my getaway
[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave
[Chorus]
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's
They haunt me
 
like ghosts
They want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
, 
ex's and oh's
[Verse 2]
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring, my, my
How the seasons go by
I get high and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll, you know
That's how the story goes"

Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life
[Verse 1]
Take me on a date, I deserve it, babe
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right, I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries, buy-buying what you need
You got the 9 to 5, but baby, so do I
So don't be thinkin' I'll be home and baking apple pies
I never learned to cook, but I can write a hook
Sing along with me, sing, sing along with me (Hey)
[Pre-Chorus]
You've gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm actin' crazy
Tell me everything's alright
[Chorus]
Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life
Dear future husband
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night (Woo)"

I'm such a fan, I'm so glad he wanted to be a part of this song. I wrote it in Nashville with my buddies Justin [Weaver] and Caitlyn [Smith.] Um, it's a very meaningful song to me. It's about when you have those nightmares where your loved one passes away and you wake up sweating and crying, and you go check on them and they're still there and you realize that you're not promised tomorrow, so you're gonna love them like you're losing them."

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1]
I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money,
 dazed and kinda lonely
[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
I make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy"

Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story
[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy"

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac
[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)"

You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"

But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
[Verse 1]
My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
[Pre-Chorus]
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning!
[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh
[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
 with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And 
I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

Wave after wave, wave after wave

 With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

Liam

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
[Chorus: All & 
Harry
]
(Ooh) 
We're only gettin' older, baby
(Ooh) 
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
(Ooh) 
Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) 
Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) 
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) 
Disappearin' when you wake up
(Ooh) 
But there's nothin' to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) 
Even when the night changes
(Ooh) 
It will never change me and you
[Verse 2: Louis & 
Niall

Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', 
doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants"

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
[Verse 1]
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one"

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
2016,2,Sorry,Justin Bieber,https://genius.com/Justin-bieber-sorry-lyrics,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]
[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[Drop]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter"

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?"

2016,9,Can't Stop the Feeling!,Justin Timberlake,https://genius.com/Justin-timberlake-cant-stop-the-feeling-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
[Refrain]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)
[Chorus]
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'"

2016,12,7 Years,Lukas Graham,https://genius.com/Lukas-graham-7-years-lyrics,"[Chorus]
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old
[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old
[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old

Mustard on the beat, ho!
[Verse 1]
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
[Chorus]
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me"

Open up the champagne, pop
It's my house, come on, turn it up, uh
[Verse 1]
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before, so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
[Post-Chorus]
(Uh) Welcome to my house
(Hey) Welcome to my house
[Verse 2]
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate (That's how we do)
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live (You know where I live)
Yeah, you know what we is (You know what we is)
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was somethin' to do
I'm livin' out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin', stuck up on that stage singin'
[Post-Chorus]
All I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
Darlin', all I know
Are sad songs, sad songs
[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer
Who already blew his shot
I get along with oldtimers 'cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up"

A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?"""

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain

Don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest (Ayy)
Still not understandin' this logic (Ayy)
I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, ""Just listen"""

Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger"

Trumpman Trumpman Trumpman that boy’s up to somethin’
Got elected somehow knowing close to nothin’
America was great before he started bluffin’
Tell me how this happened, let’s have a discussion, woo
I really wanted Clinton now she’s in the woods like woo
What demographic wanted this, you need to tell me who?
Had to be something that news stations must have really missed
We covered him a lot but never thought it’d come to this?
Intellectual
Trumpman Trumpman Trumpman, he was up to somethin’
Outlandish statements kept the media buzzin’*
Thrives on controversy and just keeps it comin’
Drops divisive rhetoric like it means nothin’ woo
Racial resentment he was enflaming like woo
Trumpman, Trumpman, Trumpman, he was always hating woo,
Trumpman, Trumpman, Trumpman, wanted the best ratings woo
Trumpman took advantage of voter frustrations woo"

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you, and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
And I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
[Verse]
Yeah you know I need you right now
But you're nowhere to be found
I just can't keep looking for you
I got too much thinking to do
I can't see it going through to you
No matter what the hell I try to do
I don't wanna be through with you
But I can't keep hurting me myself & I so
Me myself & I
It's not worth it
I need to keep a distance
Just to keep myself from hurting
Me myself & I or you
Don't know what to do
But everyday it's getting easier to choose
And you know I wanna choose you
I can't lose you
But even if I choose to
I can't refuse you
You were the only one for me
You were what I'm used to
I promised I would never hurt you
I would never use you
But you used me, and now I'm on my own
I never had the courage to be so alone
You know that I got Drake's ""Take Care"" on the low

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh
[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
 with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And 
I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here"

I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now-ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

I'm such a fan, I'm so glad he wanted to be a part of this song. I wrote it in Nashville with my buddies Justin [Weaver] and Caitlyn [Smith.] Um, it's a very meaningful song to me. It's about when you have those nightmares where your loved one passes away and you wake up sweating and crying, and you go check on them and they're still there and you realize that you're not promised tomorrow, so you're gonna love them like you're losing them."

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else

Hola, holana
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep telling me this and telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back
Now I got a lesson, that I want to teach
I'ma show you that where you from don’t matter to me
[Chorus]
She said ""Hola, ¿cómo estás?"", she said ""こんにちは""
She said ""Pardon my French"", I said ""Bonjour, madame""
Then she said ""Sak pase"" and I said ""N'ap boule""
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said ""Hola, ¿cómo estás?"", she said ""こんにちは""
She said ""Pardon my French"", I said ""Bonjour, madame""
Then she said ""Sak pase"" and I said ""N'ap boule""
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
[Verse 1]
African American for sho
I told her, ""Baby come and ride the rodeo""
Every time I come around man, I go for broke
She gives me desktop til' I overload
Now baby you gon' go where you pos to go
'Cause I ain't got time for you every day
She said she got a man keep it on the low
I said he don’t speak English, fuck he gon' say (Aye)"
2016,49,H.O.L.Y.,Florida Georgia Line,https://genius.com/Florida-georgia-line-holy-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me
[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in
[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
[Verse 2]
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven"

I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough till we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started
The temperature's risin' in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waitin' and waitin' for you to make a move (
Ooh
)
Before I make a move (
Ooh
)
[Chorus]
So baby, come light me up
And baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us
So baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a
Little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you"

Don't care what you say to me
I'ma bite your feelings out (Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
But your brother was a good substitute for you
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
When the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry, honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
[Chorus]
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know
Roof was on, let me, love me
Without ever letting you know
Roof was on, let me, love me, on, but you, know

This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah, I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me
Do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways
Got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)
[Chorus]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
[Interlude]
Break it down, yeah
Yessir
Check
[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up, have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so-so (Yeah)"

I think about all the time
Think you may need (What?) all of mine

To make every day your birthday
And every night your Valentine

I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale"

[Verse 1]
Seni en kötü ruh haline sokmaya çalışıyorum, ah
P1 arabam senin kilise ayakkabılarından daha temiz, ah
Ona verdiğim bir nokta iki milyon dolar sadece canını yakmak içindi, ah
Tüm sahip olduğum Lamborghini'ler sadece seni kızdırmak için, ah
Bu arabaların hiçbiri kiralık değil, ah
Senin yıllık kazancını bir haftada kazanırım, ah
Birinci sürtüğüm senin liginde değil, ah
İkinci sürtüğüm de senin liginde değil, ah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ev çok boş, ortaya bir şey lazım
Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum
Bebeğim o masanın üzerinde kokainleri sıralara ayırıyor
Sonra burnu ile temizliyor, adamım, bebeğimi seviyorum
Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum
Tarzımı değiştirip, her şekile girerim
İçkimi yenileyip, her acıyı dindiririm
[Chorus]
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um"

2016,61,In the Night,The Weeknd,https://genius.com/The-weeknd-in-the-night-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know (Know)
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when (When)
You wake up, she's always gone, gone, gone, oh
[Chorus]
In the night, she hears him calling
In the night, she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night, when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand"

What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck? Mm
That's gold, show me some respect (Oh-ah)

I thank God every day (Uh-huh)
That I woke up feelin' this way (Uh-huh)

And I don't need nobody else, no

I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too, I'd wanna be me too
[Verse 2]
I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo

They can't do it like I do"

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand, woah
And then I let him go
Now there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK, hey-hey
Until I made my getaway
[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's
They haunt me
 
like ghosts
They want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring, my, my

Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights, mm, that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
[Chorus]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
[Post-Chorus]
A happy man, baby, mm
[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothin' better than you in my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love"

Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day
[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day..."

2016,78,"Sit Still, Look Pretty",Daya,https://genius.com/Daya-sit-still-look-pretty-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Could dress up to get love, but guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up in makeup and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy
[Pre-Chorus]
I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king
[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know what you been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9-to-5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
[Verse 2]
Mr. Right could be nice for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had seven men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for"
2016,79,Wildest Dreams,Taylor Swift,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-wildest-dreams-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now"

2016,81,On My Mind,Ellie Goulding,https://genius.com/Ellie-goulding-on-my-mind-lyrics,"[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh
[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
[Chorus]
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind"

2016,83,When We Were Young,Adele,https://genius.com/Adele-when-we-were-young-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
, 
you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me"
2016,84,Hide Away,Daya,https://genius.com/Daya-hide-away-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
[Pre-Chorus]
To be fly as a mother (Hey)
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right (Hey)
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em (Hey)
But I hope they all come out tonight (Hey)
[Chorus]
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
[Verse 2]
Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
[Pre-Chorus]
To be fly as a mother (Hey)
To supply all of my heart's demands (Hey)
Suit and tie, 'cause undercover (Hey)
He's gonna save my life like Superman (Hey)"

2016,88,Watch Me,Silentó,https://genius.com/Computerwife-no-patience-lyrics,"I have zero patience for this endless institution
I have been pathetic for a year
I don't think you understand that I have been alluding
To a monumental [?]
But I'm back inside a haze again
If I could always see this way
I'd be content every day
Bored forever
I didn't know what I had missed
Until I felt this gentleness
Let's sink into the easy life together
I don't feel at home in my life here anymore
Throwing up on the bed watch me
Silent on the door
I wokе up dreaming of a chain tied to my neck
Evеn when I'm sleeping there's a tendency towards threat
I wanna feel that haze again
You can't be satisfied with all my anger streaks
But I'd never act that way if you were here with me
Didn't know what I had missing
Until I felt this gentleness
Let's sink into this easy life together
Don't you miss being by my side together
Don't you miss being by my side together
Let's sink into this easy life together"

Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek

[Indecipherable]
[Verse 1]
""Turn your magic on,"" Umi, she'd say
""Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends every day""
That's what she told me
""Turn your magic on,"" to me, she'd say
""Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds""
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel
[Chorus]
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
[Verse 2]
Said, ""I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"""
2016,96,Humble and Kind,Tim McGraw,https://genius.com/Tim-mcgraw-humble-and-kind-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind
[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind
[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind"

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
[Chorus: Harry, 
All

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
[Verse 2: Niall]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time"

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body"

Kommer mot mitt håll
Så tacksam för det, det är en sådan välsignelse, yeah
Gör varje situation till ett paradis, yeah
Oh-oh, du är
Min soluppgång på den mörkaste dagen
Fått mig känna mig på ett visst sätt
Gör att jag vill njuta av varje ögonblick långsamt, långsamt
Du passar mig perfekt, älskar sättet som du sätter på det
Har den enda nyckeln, vet hur du sätter på den
Sättet du nafsar på mitt öra, de enda orden jag vill höra
Älskling, ta det långsamt så att vi kan hålla länge
[Vers 1: Luis Fonsi & 
Daddy Yankee
]
Oh du, du är magneten och jag är metallen
Jag kommer bara närmare och klurar ut planen
Bara tanken höjer min hjärtfrekvens (
Oh, yeah
)
Oh, ja, jag, jag gillar dig redan mer än vanligt
Alla mina sinnen ber om mer
Det här måste tas utan brådska
[Refräng: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, 
Daddy Yankee
]
Långsamt
Jag vill lukta på din nacke långsamt
Låt mig viska saker i ditt öra
Så att du även minns när jag inte är med
Långsamt
Jag vill klä av dig med mina kyssar, långsamt
Jag signerar väggarna av din labyrint
Och gör hela din kropp till ett manuskript

Hoppa på, hoppa på, hoppa på!

Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Strophe 1: Chris Martin]
Ich habe alte Bücher gelesen
Die von Legenden und Mythen handelten
Achilles und sein Gold
Herkules und seine Geschenke
Spidermans Kontrolle
Und Batman mit seinen Fäusten
Und natürlich sehe ich mich selbst nicht auf dieser Liste
[Pre-Refrain: Chris Martin]
Sie sagte: Wohin würdest du gehen wollen?
Wie viel willst du riskieren?
Ich suche nicht nach irgendjemandem
Mit übermenschlichen Kräften
Ein bisschen Superheld
Ein bisschen Märchenglück
Einfach etwas, in was ich mich verwandeln kann
Jemanden, den ich küssen kann
[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Ich will etwas genau wie das
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, ich will etwas genau wie das

2017,8,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt,https://genius.com/Sam-hunt-body-like-a-back-road-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets
[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile"
2017,9,Believer,Imagine Dragons,https://genius.com/Imagine-dragons-believer-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the
[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
[Verse 3]
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh"

2017,11,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,https://genius.com/James-arthur-say-you-wont-let-go-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
[Chorus]
I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
[Post-Chorus]
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night"

[Verse 1]
Seni en kötü ruh haline sokmaya çalışıyorum, ah
P1 arabam senin kilise ayakkabılarından daha temiz, ah
Ona verdiğim bir nokta iki milyon dolar sadece canını yakmak içindi, ah
Tüm sahip olduğum Lamborghini'ler sadece seni kızdırmak için, ah
Bu arabaların hiçbiri kiralık değil, ah
Senin yıllık kazancını bir haftada kazanırım, ah
Birinci sürtüğüm senin liginde değil, ah
İkinci sürtüğüm de senin liginde değil, ah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ev çok boş, ortaya bir şey lazım
Bu yüzden abanoz ağacından kesilmiş, yirmi bin dolarlık bir masa koydum
Bebeğim o masanın üzerinde kokainleri sıralara ayırıyor
Sonra burnu ile temizliyor, adamım, bebeğimi seviyorum
Hep paran hakkında konuşuyorsun, işitme cihazına ihtiyacın var
Benim hakkımda konuşuyorsun, üzerimde gölge göremiyorum
Tarzımı değiştirip, her şekile girerim
İçkimi yenileyip, her acıyı dindiririm
[Chorus]
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um
Şu yaptığınıza bir bakın
Ben lanet olası bir Starboy'um"
2017,21,Location,Khalid,https://genius.com/Khalid-location-lyrics,"[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(do not need nothing else but you)
[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't
[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)"

Woah-oh, hm-hmm
[Verse 1]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up (Ah)
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight
[Chorus]
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, huh
[Verse 2]
You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know that you won, oh"
2017,23,There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,Shawn Mendes,https://genius.com/Shawn-mendes-theres-nothing-holdin-me-back-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation"

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance
[Chorus]
Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves
[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill"
2017,25,Redbone,Childish Gambino,https://genius.com/Childish-gambino-redbone-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feelin' like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishin' I could make this mine, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
(If you want it) Yeah
(You can have it) Oh, oh, oh
(If you need it) Ooh
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
You can have it
[Chorus]
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes"

Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım
[Verse 1: Kyle]
Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil

I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down

And I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just as fast

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me, and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But
[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)

If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane

Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right

2017,41,Bad Things,Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello,https://genius.com/Billboard-camila-cabello-talks-solo-music-life-after-fifth-harmony-annotated,"CABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.
CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.
As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.
Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.
Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).
But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.
She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.
“It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”
But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.
“You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”
The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)
Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.
The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle."

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still"

Ya empezamos cómo es

Mi gente no se detiene, aquí nadie se quiere ir
Si el ritmo está en tu cabeza
Ahora suéltate y mueve los pies
Me encanta cuando el bajo suena
Empezamos a subir de nivel
Y toda mi gente se mueve (Rrra)
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes

You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments

Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad, I cannot do no wrong

[Adam Levine]
Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que eu não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo
A cada respiração sua
Eu percebo que tem algo acontecendo
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria
Nós estamos dando um tempo ou terminando?
Não consigo entender as entrelinhas
Me pedindo por espaço aqui na minha casa
Você sabe como ferrar comigo
Agindo como se não estivéssemos juntos
Depois de tudo que passamos juntos
Dormindo sobre segredos
Como posso estar tão longe de você?
Distante, quando estamos nos beijando
Parece tão diferente
Querida, me diga como você ficou
[Coro]
Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que eu não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo
A cada respiração sua
Eu percebo que tem algo acontecendo
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria, sim"

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me

Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine
[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out

Driving us to your house"

'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you

A la una de la tarde de ese mismo día
Julio y Tenoch emprendieron el regreso
Fue un viaje sin eventualidades y muy silencioso
Sus familias no se enteraron de que su viaje fue a la playa
Ni de la compańía de Luisa
Ella se quedó en San Bernabé para comenzar al día siguiente su exploración por las Bahías de la zona
Al despedirse de Tenoch y Julio, Luisa les dijo:
La vida es como la espuma por eso hay que darse como el mar
[Chorus: Madi]
Stop playing with me
Not sure how to feel
And I'm too drunk to see
It’s my mind you always steal
What's even real, oh, what's even there
I’m not sure but I want more
[Verse 1: Lily]
I spend too much time on Tiktok yuh
Shake that ass or kick rocks
Rocks like Bedrock
Rocks like red rock
At the Grand Canyon
I would fuck Megan Thee Stallion
She said wet ass pussy, well, like a river
And I got your bitch buyin' me dinner
My stomach is full but I still pull
Pull on the stick while I pull your bitch
I hate being lonely
So I fuck on the homies
You can say I want the whole crew
But your mom, she's a hoe too
How do I know you ask?
Well last night I was tappin' that ass
Let's switch up the flow
Pour me some more

Not even a little bit
But I got problems just like Ari and Iggy said
Too Biggie to be here stressin'
Lemme teach you a lesson
I'll kill you with these bars
They gon’ take your ass on a stretcher, nah
But on some real shit, I’m just tryna hit
Don't leave me celibate, I’ll hit you on your cell in a bit
I'm just tryna sell the next big hit
You hear that flush? Yeah it's me, I'm the shit
I just dropped a deuce, I’m feelin' loose, sippin' this juice

We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?
[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us
Enough is enough, oh"

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
[Pre-Chorus]
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here"

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here (Here, here, here)
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)
But not if you are so reckless
[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge"

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)
[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song"

Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?

Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?

Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, down, d-d-d-down?

You know we could put them all to shame
Now isn't the time to play it safe
Isn't this the reason why you came?
So, baby, don't you let it go to waste
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Every single thing is feeling right
Started as a quiet Friday night
I don't really think that we should fight this
What if we don't stop until it's light?
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?"

I won't lie to you

When you say that he's the one that you want

And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?

Little hat down, little John Deere

You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me
[Verse 2]
She likes my T-shirt, she likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'd take a full moon over them city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I could smooth it out, I could stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough"

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own"

But my heart's been hurt a couple times

Show me what you're made of

We know that Christ died for all who have good intentions

This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yeah

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya

'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many"

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak"

You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now

2018,32,Tequila,Dan + Shay,https://genius.com/Dan-shay-tequila-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Shay, 
with Dan
]
I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine
[Chorus: Dan + Shay, 
Dan
]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (
When I, when I, when I
)
When I taste tequila (
When I, when I, when I
)
[Verse 2: Shay, 
with Dan
]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard
[Chorus: Dan + Shay, 
Dan
]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (
When I, when I, when I

When I taste tequila (
When I, when I, when I

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still"
2018,34,MotorSport,"Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B",https://genius.com/Genius-russia-how-to-add-song-credits-to-genius-annotated,"Что такое кре́дитсы?
Это список музыкантов, принимавших участие в создании песни. Они делятся на следующие категории:
Artist:
 Исполнитель, от имени которого вышла песня. Кредитсы Genius должны строго соответствовать данным со стриминговых сервисов, прежде всего Apple Music. Если там главный исполнитель представлен списком из нескольких артистов (как в «MotorSport» Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B), то и вам в поле «Artist» нужно сгруппировать имена всех исполнителей в одну запись, затем через функцию «Add Additional Credits» создать поле «Primary Artists» и уже там указать имя каждого из исполнителей по отдельности.
Исключением являются «супергруппы» — музыкальные коллективы, собранные из уже состоявшихся артистов. На стриминговых сервисах их названия часто дополняют именами участников (например, KIDS SEE GHOSTS, Kanye West & Kid Cudi). Для упрощения оставьте только название группы.
Writers:
 В поле авторов указывают людей, которые участвовали в создании песни: причём к ним относятся как авторы музыки, так и авторы слов.
Featured Artists:
 Приглашённые исполнители — это артисты, которые сделали значительный вклад в создание песни. Как правило, своим вокалом или соавторством.
Producers
: Тут имеются в виду продюсеры музыки. В хип-хопе чаще всего это человек, написавший бит.
Additional Credits:
 Этот раздел охватывает всех остальных профессионалов, сделавших вклад в создание песни: сюда входят музыканты, игравшие на определенных инструментах, звукорежиссёры и т.д.
Когда нужно/нельзя добавлять кредитсы?
Добавлять данные на Genius можно, 
ТОЛЬКО
 если они были предоставлены официально. Это значит, что:
Заполнять кредитсы на основе собственных домыслов строго запрещено
Будьте готовы в любой момент предъявить авторитетный источник, подтверждающий ваши кредитсы
Чтобы не засорять дискографии исполнителей, никогда не заполняйте кредитсы для страниц следующего типа:
Переводы песен
Фанатские мэшапы
Неофициальные ремиксы
Неофициально изданные каверы
Песни, созданные с помощью искусственного интеллекта (ИИ)
Где искать кредитсы
Буклет альбома:
 На разворотах буклетов большинства физических носителей (компакт-дисков, виниловых пластинок) размещают кредитсы. При покупке цифровой версии альбома подобные буклеты иногда прилагаются в электронном виде.
Общества по защите авторских прав:
 Это организации, помогающие исполнителям получать отчисления за их музыкальные произведения. Чтобы авторское общество знало, кому выплачивать деньги, авторы регистрируют свои песни в реестре этого общества. 
—> 
Как искать кредитсы на сайтах авторских обществ
Стриминговые сервисы:
 Такие стриминги, как Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL 
(а для русскоязычных исполнителей ещё и Яндекс Музыка)
 хранят кредитсы у себя в метаданных. 
—> 
Как искать кредитсы на стриминговых сервисах
Социальные медиа:
 Информацию об авторах песен нередко предоставляют авторитетные СМИ и даже сами исполнители у себя в соцсетях. Её можно использовать в качестве кредитсов, если источник заслуживает доверия.
Прочие сайты:
 Профессиональные сайты по сбору музыкальных метаданных, вроде AllMusic или Discogs, вполне подходят в качестве источников. Краудсорсинговые сайты, вроде Википедии, можно использовать в качестве справочных материалов, но информация оттуда требует подкрепления дополнительными ресурсами.
Перечень музыкальных профессий и их принятое написание
Одна и та же музыкальная профессия в разных источниках может именоваться немного по-разному, поэтому мы разработали собственный перечень с названиями музыкантов. При заполнении кредистов обращайтесь к нему, чтобы выбрать форму написания, принятую у нас на сайте. Обратите внимание, что в списке перечислены только часто используемые кредитсы. Если кредитс, который вы хотите указать, не добавляется, обратитесь к 
редакторам или модераторам
 за помощью. При заполнении кредитсов помните, что у каждой роли 
должно быть отдельное поле.
Для каждой из музыкальных профессий в списке ниже в скобках указан русский перевод. При заполнении данных перевод указывать не нужно — используйте только название на английском.

I might have to tell you somethin' (Damn)

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you
[Post-Chorus]
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)

Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (
Gimme the loot!

Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose"

Promis, juré, jusqu'à la mort
À mon amour, jamais je ne mentirais
Il a dit ""Sois sincère"" je promets que j'essaierai
En fin de compte, c'est lui et moi
Il est perturbé, je perds la tête
Nous avons cet amour, du genre fou
Je suis à lui, et il est à moi
En fin de compte, c'est lui et moi
[Couplet 1: G-Eazy & (Halsey)]
À toute vitesse avec ma 1965 sur la PCH, une satanée balade
Ils ne veulent pas nous voir y arriver, ils veulent juste nous séparer
2017 Bonnie & Clyde
Je ne verrais pas l'intérêt de vivre si l'un d'entre-nous mourrait, ouais
On a ce genre de style que tout le monde essaie de copier
Robe YSL en-dessous quand elle enlève le vison
Soie sur son corps, la tirer et la regarder glisser
Si elle me prenait à la tromper, elle essaierait de me couper la (Ha ha ha)
Folle, mais je l'aime, je ne pourrais jamais m'éloigner d'elle
J'attaque, pas de préservatif, je ne laisserais jamais personne la toucher
J'te jure on se stimule l'un l'autre, mec, elle est si têtue
Mais, qu'est l'amour sans douleur et sans souffrance?
Intense, ce truc devient dense
Elle sait quand j'adhère plus comme si elle pouvait le sentir
Si j'avais un million de dollars, ou que je n'avais que dix cents
Elle serait ok pour tout, jamais à convaincre"

Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I coulda did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
[Pre-Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for"

And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preachin' the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money
[Pre-Chorus ]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now
[Chorus]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without cryin' so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me
[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know her daddy's been dreadin' this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one givin' her away"

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time"

The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile

Ódio! Querem que eu acabe com isso igual o caso do T.I
Oh (Ódio!) e se estiver quente, eu vou alimentar meu rosto

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down

Get along while we can

Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try

To drown out the noise

But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

I lied when I said

Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done"

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza
Ya empezamos cómo es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie
Así que vamos a romper
Con lo mío todos se mueven
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes
Yo soy la reina de los nenes
Mi gente no se detiene, aquí nadie se quiere ir
Si el ritmo está en tu cabeza
Ahora suéltate y mueve los pies
Me encanta cuando el bajo suena
Empezamos a subir de nivel
Y toda mi gente se mueve (Rrra)
La fiesta la llevo en mis genes
Yo soy la reina de los nenes
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando y se baila así (Leggo)

Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me
[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep
[Verse 1]
Located in Orlando
Acute bleeding from the beginning is hot water, I'm taking a shower
He didn't know his name
I'm sorry, it's completely meaningless, that does not exist
Kuwait, Kuwait, sometimes we live in the sea
It's a beautiful tooth
His body fits into my ducks
Everything is wet, yes, yes
[Chorus]
I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Yes,
 
no no no no, oh no God
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la

Bulunmak istemediğim bir partideyim
Ve hiç takım elbise giymem ve kravat takmam
Merak ediyorum arkadan gizlice girebilir miyim?
Kimse gözlerime bile bakmıyor
Elimi tutabilir misin?
İçkimi bitirip, diyorum ki, ""Dans edelim mi?"" (Lanet olsun, evet)
Seni sevdiğimi biliyorsun, sana hiç söylemiş miydim?
Bunu böyle daha iyi yapıyorsun
[Ön Nakarat: Ed Sheeran]
Bu partiye uyduğumu düşünmüyorum
Herkesin diyeceği çok şey var (Evet)
Her zaman hiç kimseymişim gibi hissediyorum, mmm
Zaten kim uyum sağlamak istiyor ki?
[Nakarat: Ed Sheeran]
Çünkü bebeğimleyken umrumda değil, evet
Tüm kötü şeyler ortadan kayboluyor
Ve sen bana belki ben biriymişim gibi hissettiriyorsun
Kötü gecelerle başa çıkabilirim
Bebeğimleyken, evet
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Çünkü beni yakında tuttuğun sürece umrumda değil
Beni herhangi bir yere götürebilirsin
Ve beni biri tarafından seviliyormuşum gibi hissettiriyorsun
Kötü gecelerle başa çıkabilirim
Bebeğimleyken, evet

I'm not, I'm so sober

My name is Devvon Terrell
This is a raw session
You know the vibes

Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets
[Bridge: Devvon Terrell]
I see you and I know you legit (Yeah)
High off you, I need a fix (Yeah)
You a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm

You good, T-Minus?
[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice"

What it's doin' to me ain't a secret

Every time you walk into the room

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses

And see the world through whiskey glasses

Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is 
God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face
[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""
[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay"

You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
Two bullets in your chest, that's a nipple
And if a nigga run up, I'ma pop him like a pimple
Get rich or die tryin', I'm feelin' like 50
Brand new chopper got double-D titties
Nigga, don't play me, I don't get silly
Love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah"

Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' here watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe
[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
[Verse 2]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar"

We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
[Verse 2]
Speakin' of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room"

I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night
[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself
[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah
[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all, all, all to myself
To myself, yeah"

There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?
[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside
[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm
[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight

Man, what?
This shit funny, one second
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Don't hurt me, love)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave for my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said you loved me first (First)
One thing my dad told me was
""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time you're insecure""
I can't see it through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?"

Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh"

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go"

I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at
 (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city

Did a full one-eighty, crazy

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side"

Walk in your rainbow paradise (Paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey (Ah-ah-ah)
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Your wonder under summer skies (Summer skies)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?"

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Verse 1]
There's a time that I remember when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, 
ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you"

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, 
the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When 
there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing
[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good"

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape
[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'
Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry
[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)"

They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

So they say
""Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before""
They say
""Move for me, move for me, move for me, eh-eh-eh
And when you’re done, I'll make you do it all again""

Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin’ my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time"

All for the 'Gram
Bitches love the 'Gram
Oh, wait, shit

Skrrt skrrt

[Chorus]
Roxanne, Roxanne
All she wanna do is party all night
Goddamn, Roxanne
Never gonna love me, but it's alright
She think I'm an asshole, she think I'm a player
She keep running back, though, only 'cause I pay up
Roxanne, Roxanne
All she wanna do is party all night
[Verse 1]
Met her at a party in the hills, yeah
She just wanna do it for the thrill, yeah
Shorty drive a poodle with no top (Top, top)
But if I throw this money, she gon' drop, ayy
She don't wait in lines if it's too long
She don't drive the whip unless the roof off
Only wanna call when the cash out
Only take the pic when her ass out"

MEMORIAS DE NAVIDAD
Víctor Manuelle"
2020,18,Everything I Wanted,Billie Eilish,https://genius.com/Billie-eilish-everything-i-wanted-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"""
2020,19,Roses (Imanbek remix),Saint Jhn,https://genius.com/Saint-jhn-roses-imanbek-remix-lyrics,"[Refrain]
Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screamin' dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it poppin', I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses
[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna
And I know you won't tell nobody nothin'
And I know you won't tell nobody no
[Bridge]
Roses
I might pull up flexin' on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her, ""Girl, you cute but ballin',"" that shit gorgeous
Standin' on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the God is"
2020,20,Watermelon Sugar,Harry Styles,https://genius.com/Harry-styles-watermelon-sugar-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
[Chorus]
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
[Verse 2]
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without"
2020,21,Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,https://genius.com/Lewis-capaldi-before-you-go-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say
[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
[
Chorus
]
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go
[Verse 2]
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face"
2020,22,Falling,Trevor Daniel,https://genius.com/Trevor-daniel-falling-lyrics,"[Intro]
Oh
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya
[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one"

Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down

But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

2020,42,Woah,Lil Baby,https://genius.com/Lil-baby-woah-lyrics,"[Intro]
New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming
[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper"
2020,43,Death Bed,Powfu featuring Beabadoobee,https://genius.com/Aj8585vevo-powfus-death-bed-remix-lyrics,"[Intro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting marriеd, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bеd
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)"

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep
[Verse 1]
Located in Orlando
Acute bleeding from the beginning is hot water, I'm taking a shower
He didn't know his name
I'm sorry, it's completely meaningless, that does not exist
Kuwait, Kuwait, sometimes we live in the sea
It's a beautiful tooth
His body fits into my ducks
Everything is wet, yes, yes
[Chorus]
I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Yes,
 
no no no no, oh no God
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep"
2020,45,Highest in the Room,Travis Scott,https://genius.com/Travis-scott-highest-in-the-room-lyrics,"[Chorus]
I got room in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It’s lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)
[Verse 1]
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I’m doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Case it’s fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I’m the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let’s go, yeah)"
2020,46,Bad Guy,Billie Eilish,https://genius.com/Billie-eilish-bad-guy-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
[Pre-Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
[Chorus]
I'm the bad guy
[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know"
2020,47,Mood,24kGoldn featuring Iann Dior,https://genius.com/Merkules-mood-24kgold-and-iann-dior-remix-lyrics,"I take a hit until I feel light headed
No matter what I say it's like they still don't get it, yeah
It's a real pandemic…
I'm smoking and I’m drinking 'till I feel pathetic, yeah
Maybe there's somethin' I'm tryna numb
I've been runnin' from my problems so I'm fucked up on these drugs, oh no
No wonder why something feels outta touch
Cause they'll stab you in the back at the same time they show you love, I swear
I don't know why I let it happen, broken hearts in all my captions
I get so high that I'm distracted, I guess this what they meant when thеy said shit happens
I feel like I don't got much left to provе, I don't think that you could walk much in my shoes
Maybe this is karma, that could be true, but it's one of those days And I'm in one of those moods
I keep on tellin' myself that it's me against the world I don’t need anyone else
I'm tryna better myself but it's hard 'cause this motherfuckin' Henny don't help
I dont know what to do, when one shot quickly turn to two, now I’m bout to send it with the crew
Man I think I need some more, when three shots quickly turn to four
Police keep on knockin' at the door
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
There’s no goin' back
Another mornin' where I wake up to a drunk text
Half the time I wish that all this success sucked less
Rock star life style I could give a fuck less
Maybe I should work more, and I should get drunk less
Or maybe you should mind your own business
I don't expect the losin' team to get it
I don't say it till I live it
I'm startin' to think maybe that’s the difference
Cause everything these rappers say is fiction, it ain't hard to tell
That it's see throughhh, I'm independent mawfucka
I don't need youuu
I just went and got a crib with a beach vieww
If I was you then id probably hate me too
I hate me tooooo"
2020,48,Rain on Me,Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande,https://genius.com/Eqric-chenda-jex-rain-on-me-lady-gaga-and-ariana-grande-cover-lyrics,"I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
La la la la la (Rain, rain)
La la la la la (Rain, rain)
La, La La la la la la (Rain, rain)
Rain on me, oh yeah
Rain on me
Rain on me
Living in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind
Baby, yeah"

S
peakerBangerz
Look, uh, look
[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I 
can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me
[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah
[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me"

Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani
]
Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me
[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
[Verse 2: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]
All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing"
2020,53,Trampoline,Shaed,https://genius.com/Shaed-trampoline-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)
[Verse 2]
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home"

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!
[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs"

Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла

Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана ""Мозга"" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...
[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер

В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр

To come and look at my front door?

And keep that pistol in the drawer

I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess

2020,74,Emotionally Scarred,Lil Baby,https://genius.com/Lil-baby-emotionally-scarred-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah"

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd
 
(
Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather"

Я могу вывезти тебя хоть куда, нахуй реактивный тариф
Отель Versace на мне Versace халат, воу, воу
Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём

City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat

They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you

Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad

Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished"
2020,93,Does to Me,Luke Combs featuring Eric Church,https://genius.com/Luke-combs-does-to-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me"

2020,96,More Than My Hometown,Morgan Wallen,https://genius.com/Morgan-wallen-more-than-my-hometown-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
[Chorus]
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
[Verse 2]
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that"
2020,97,Lovin' on You,Luke Combs,https://genius.com/Luke-combs-lovin-on-you-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
[Verse 2]
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth"

Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, ""Get out that Range""
Her mani and pedi same color my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Karate'd the Wocky, tryna kick the cup  (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed (Haha)

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the 
moonlight
)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars"

Yeah
[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh"
2021,4,Mood,24kGoldn featuring Iann Dior,https://genius.com/Merkules-mood-24kgold-and-iann-dior-remix-lyrics,"I take a hit until I feel light headed
No matter what I say it's like they still don't get it, yeah
It's a real pandemic…
I'm smoking and I’m drinking 'till I feel pathetic, yeah
Maybe there's somethin' I'm tryna numb
I've been runnin' from my problems so I'm fucked up on these drugs, oh no
No wonder why something feels outta touch
Cause they'll stab you in the back at the same time they show you love, I swear
I don't know why I let it happen, broken hearts in all my captions
I get so high that I'm distracted, I guess this what they meant when thеy said shit happens
I feel like I don't got much left to provе, I don't think that you could walk much in my shoes
Maybe this is karma, that could be true, but it's one of those days And I'm in one of those moods
I keep on tellin' myself that it's me against the world I don’t need anyone else
I'm tryna better myself but it's hard 'cause this motherfuckin' Henny don't help
I dont know what to do, when one shot quickly turn to two, now I’m bout to send it with the crew
Man I think I need some more, when three shots quickly turn to four
Police keep on knockin' at the door
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
No I will not slow down
There’s no goin' back
Another mornin' where I wake up to a drunk text
Half the time I wish that all this success sucked less
Rock star life style I could give a fuck less
Maybe I should work more, and I should get drunk less
Or maybe you should mind your own business
I don't expect the losin' team to get it
I don't say it till I live it
I'm startin' to think maybe that’s the difference
Cause everything these rappers say is fiction, it ain't hard to tell
That it's see throughhh, I'm independent mawfucka
I don't need youuu
I just went and got a crib with a beach vieww
If I was you then id probably hate me too
I hate me tooooo"

(Ah)
[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you"

I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right
[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can
[Chorus]
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
[Post-Chorus]

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you

Watching reruns of 
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good"

Shawty go joggin' every morning (Every morning)
And she make me breakfast almost every morning (Every morning)
And she take a naked pic before she leave the door
I be wakin' up to pics before a nigga yawnin'
And every weekend my shawty comin' over (Over)
Shawty could Fendi out, but she like Fashion Nova (Nova)
She ain't drivin' no Camry, she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby
[Chorus]
She said, ""What you know 'bout love?"" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please
We 'bout to get it on, take off them drawers (I said I love you, baby)
It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (I love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see (Oh)
[Verse 2]
Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front (Uh)
You got my heart beatin' so fast to words I can't pronounce
And I be gettin' the chills every time I feel your touch
I be lookin' at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice (Word)
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like (Like, nah)
And yo' ass be lookin' so fat when it be in them tights (In them tights)
And I'm goin' straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
You always keep me right, for a fact, you never left (Left)
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best (My best)
So here's fifty-five hunnid, go and get your breasts (Your breasts)
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissin' on your neck
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter (Batter)
Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play (Make a play)
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure
I think I'm fallin' in love"

Ich habe nicht verloren, seit ich angefangen hab', yeah
Lustig, wie ihr gesagt habt, dass es vorbei sei, yeah
Dann bin ich los und hab's nochmal gemacht

Ich hab's euch schon vor langer Zeit „On the Road“ gesagt
Ich hab' das, worauf sie warten
Ich renne vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass ich mich nicht verstecke
Du warst eh nie auf meiner Seite
Wenn ich wieder oben bin, will ich euch sagen hören:
Er rennt vor nichts davon, Hund
Hol deine Soldaten, sag denen, dass die Pause vorbei ist
[Part 1: Lil Nas X]
Ah, muss, ah
Muss das Album fertig bekommen
Brauch ein Paar Number Ones
Brauch 'ne Auszeichnung auf jedem Song
Brauch einen wie mit Nicki jetzt
Sag 'nem Rapper, dass ich dich nicht sehe, ha
Ich bin ein Pop-Star wie Bieber, ha
Ich ficke keine Bitches, ich bin queer, ha
Aber die sind Bitches wie Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah, ey (Yeah)

Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—"

Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
[Pre-Chorus]
Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary

On these days that feel like you and me

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I
'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec

When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I coulda ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say"

And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly"

Puta, tengo mi propio fierro, no ocupo de seguridad en el club (Nop)
Todo eso de hablar mierda en el internet (Net), negro, creía que eras un matón
No tenían a donde ir, disparé dondequiera que anduvieran (Blrrrd)
Sí, tú sabes quién te quitó esa mierda (Blrrrd), ven a recuperarlo con sangre (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Puta, ven a recuperarlo con sangre (Gran blrrrd)
No nos enmascaramos, sin evitar accidentes (Nop), los negros saben quién era (Que les jodan)
Extorsionando como en los 80s, quieres algo de vuelta, recupéralo con sangre (Dios)
Sí, tú sabes quién te quitó esa mierda (Eyy), recupéralo con sangre (Gran blrrrd, blrrrd)
[Verso 1: Pooh Shiesty]
Si el asesino de tu amigo no está muerto, no deberías llevar ninguna camisa que diga Q.E.P.D (Nop)
Teníamos trescientos tiros arriba en el coche antes de recoger a  Durk (Trescientos)
¿Quienes son ustedes, negros? No están haciendo una mierda, coge una pistola, ponte alerta (Alerta)
Shiesty G publicó ""Q.E.P.D."" y es la razón por la cual está bajo tierra (
Por mi slime
, blrrrd, blrrrd)
Has de saber que yo me paso de la raya (Vámonos)
Son dos O en este cien, uno de ellos podría representar a O'Block (Blrrrd)
Cerca de veinte tiros quedan en el K, quince aún en la Glock (El fierro)
Mantengo mi puerta desbloqueada y me paro, me gusta hacerlo caminando, estaciona el coche (Para, para), blrrrd (Estaciona el coche, blrrrd)
Vamos acercándonos, lo trato mal, no le muestro amor (Nop)
Once mil los que abandonaron mi bolsillo izquierdo en el club (Por dios)
Estos caras azules jugaron en mi contra, fuí y los saqué del barro (Por supuesto)
Si robé algo, recupéralo con sangre (Blrrrd), No me importa una mierda lo que solíamos ser (Blrrrd, blrrrd)"

'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
[Verse 1: Jung Kook]
Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing-song when I'm walkin' home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong
[Pre-Chorus: RM, 
j-hope
]
This is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go
[Chorus: Jung Kook, 
Jimin
]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh"

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)
[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)
[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks"

[Ön Nakarat: Doja Cat]
Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Ve sadece cüret, sadece alet
Beni başka biri hakkında düşündürtüyor
Biliyorsun söyleyeceğim çok şey var
Yüzümde saklamaya çalışıyorum
Ama işe yaramıyor, yüzümden okuyabiliyorsun
Sadece senle olmak istediğimi
Ve sen haklısın
[Nakarat: Doja Cat]
Sen haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum
Dedim ki haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama ben, engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum
[Bölüm 1: Doja Cat]
Durup başka yere bakamıyorum
Çünkü biliyorum olabilir, bebeğim, ve sеn aynısını hissetmeyebilirsin
Onun hakkında hеr gün hakkında düşünüyorsun
Peri masallarına inanmıyorsun, ama bizim de fantezilerimiz var
Ve sadece ben ve sen, o yok
Çarşaflarına serilmek istiyorum
Üstümün her yerindesin
O kadar da derin değilmiş gibi davranıyorsun
Oğlum, sinirini benden çıkarabilirsin
Ne olmak üzere, söyle bana
Olmak zorundaymış gibi hissediyorum
Kimseye söyleyemem ama herkes biliyor"

[Verse]
Painted with purple to match with my syrup
My choppa got titties to match with my girl (skrrt)
Niggas say that they rich but I know that they capping
Draco in the trunk and you bet I'ma blast it
Bank and deposits and clockin' Dre's ashes
I'm smashing the gas on the 'vette, losing traction (skrrt)
Young C.E.O, came a long way from trappin'
They see this my year, I don't even gotta say it
Fuck with the bros you get stretched in the payment
I'm heating shit up see the sweat on they face (what what)
Call the promoters and tell them to pay me
I hop on the stage and the kid get it ragin' (what what)
Knock out a nigga, I feel like DaBaby
My next day I'm out so I don't even know they face
He talking slick got his neck on a shirt
2020, I need twenty a verse
Shoutout to Uzi, I slide with the Uzi
I'm finna go do a drive by out the 'vert
'Till I get 24 million I ain't chilling
My clarity go in the streets and get chilly
I jump in that pussy and stretch it and kill it
Don't do for feelings that's just how I work
Bust on her titties, she dripping like fashion
I hop out the 'ghini and skrt in the Aston
That brand new Aventador sound like a dragon
Got swag like I got the chrome heart on my fabric
Ran up the commas, I'm finna start braggin'
Don't care bout Corona, I'm rockin' a mask
Louis V monogram all on my bag
And I bought all my smoke and this shit really potent
Started at the bottom and built me a business
Somebody tell Kanye ""I'll make him a billion""
See I done diamond my shit, got appraises
We rockin' that fool shit, no we ain't the same
I don't talk smoke on the internet
I'm just gon drop a new bag and say ""bring me your brain""
Double R truck I don't bring out that Civic Si
Two out the window, I'm finna make it rain
Walk in the bank and they know me by name
Finna hit wifey and make me a chain
FN it blasted and bullets like pellets
I'm poppin' my shit, finna put on the gang
Keep my foot on they neck and that shit it Margelia
I saw they face and I kick it with fantasy
He talkin' shit and he woke up in heaven
Then why not her too man, I been tryna tell you"

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
[Verso 1]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando
[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día"

I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (Huh)

You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringing them gats out
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house
Off the '42, I'm blowing her back out (Blowing her back out)

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
[Chorus: SZA, 
Jacob Collier
 & 
Both
]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days
, good days, always
Always inside (
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
)
Good day living in my mind"

Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
[Verse 2]
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way
[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
[Verse 3]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark"

2021,55,Willow,Taylor Swift,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-willow-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"
2021,56,Bang!,AJR,https://genius.com/Ajr-bang-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, 
I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (
Here we go!
)
[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!"
2021,57,Better Together,Luke Combs,https://genius.com/Luke-combs-better-together-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns
, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here"

You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
Then I wake up with you on my chest
You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call
[Chorus: Ryan Hurd & Maren Morris]
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you werе running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing aftеr you

Wish I could quit you but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would

Make it after all"

Kiss me in the mornin', late at night
Catch me drivin' down 405
Catch me and your girl late at night, side to side
Mustard on the beat, ho
[Chorus]
Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you cum over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'
Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you
[Verse 1]
I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back"

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
[Verse 1]
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
[Chorus]
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)"

Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go

I need to make sure you know that

You are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)

Forever's not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)

Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you 
cruise
 down a 
backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night
?
[Chorus]
Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?
[Verse 2]
Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon
?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?"

Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober

4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, ""Oh my God""?

My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you"

[Verse 1]
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
With dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, comin' over to me, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but
[Chorus]
I want someone to love mе
I need someone who needs me
'Causе it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want"

[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
Pass auf dich auf
[Strophe 1: Dan Reynolds]
Ich wache auf zu den Klängen der Stille, die
Meinen Gedanken erlaubt, herumzuschweifen, mit meinem Ohr auf dem Boden
Ich suche, um die Geschichten zu sehen, die erzählt werden
Wenn ich der Welt meinen Rücken zugekehrt habe, die lächelte, als ich mich umdrehte
[Pre-Refrain: Dan Reynolds]
Sagеn dir, du seist der Größte
Abеr sobald du dich umdrehst, hassen sie uns
[Refrain: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, welch ein Jammer
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid
Alle wollen mein Feind-d-d-d-d sein
(Pass auf dich auf)
Mein Feind-d-d-d-d (Pass auf, pass auf, pass auf, pass auf)
(Pass auf dich auf)
Aber ich bin bereit
[Strophe 2: Dan Reynolds]
Deine Worte an der Wand, während du für meinen Niedergang betest
Und das Gelächter in den Hallen und die Beschimpfungen, die mir zugeworfen wurden
Ich sammle sie in meinem Kopf, und ich warte auf die Zeit
Wenn ich euch zeige, wie es ist, Worte zu sein, die in ein Mikrofon gespuckt werden"

Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place

She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

Una dominicana que es uva bombón

Eres exactamente lo que quiero un poco genial y un poco no
Quiero entregarme a ti

Powiedziałaś, że mnie kochasz, ale mnie to nie obchodzi
Że złamałem rękę na tej samej ścianie
Na której powiedziałaś mi, że on cię przeleciał (Oh)
Myślisz, że łatwo pieprzyć się z moimi uczuciami
Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi (Uh)
Coś odchodzi
(Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi, oh)
Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi
[Zwrotka 1: Post Malone]
Mówiłaś, że chcesz być matką moich dzieci
Pieprzyłem cię tak dobrze, że powinnaś mi za to płacić
Nie nazywaj mnie ""kochanie"", kiedy potraktowałaś mnie tak źle (Kiedy potraktowałaś mnie tak źle)
Lecz poradziłem sobie już z tym, co mi zrobiłaś
Oko za oko, drobnostka
Ilu twoich znajomych dogania mnie z kasą? (Czy ty jesteś w staniе mieć tyle kasy?)
Kupiłem Ci nową twarz, powinnaś mówić mi ""tato"", kochaniе
Hermès, ale upuściłaś to, kochanie
Prawda, już może nikomu nie wystarczyć"

(Ah)
[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)
[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do"

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig
[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me
[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?
[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke"

You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't

You can keep puttin' off forever with that girl who's heart you hold
Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand
'Til you can't
[Chorus]
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't

There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life

Ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)

So what you say we cancel our plans?

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, 
dancing on the clouds below
[Post-Chorus]
I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go"

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Now, I just fell in love
And I just quit my job
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night"
2022,39,Something in the Orange,Zach Bryan,https://genius.com/Zach-bryan-something-in-the-orange-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
[Verse 2]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done
[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home"

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the 
moonlight
)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars"

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop
 (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco"

Ve sadece cüret, sadece alet
Beni başka biri hakkında düşündürtüyor
Biliyorsun söyleyeceğim çok şey var

Durup başka yere bakamıyorum
Çünkü biliyorum olabilir, bebeğim, ve sеn aynısını hissetmeyebilirsin
Onun hakkında hеr gün hakkında düşünüyorsun
Peri masallarına inanmıyorsun, ama bizim de fantezilerimiz var
Ve sadece ben ve sen, o yok
Çarşaflarına serilmek istiyorum
Üstümün her yerindesin
O kadar da derin değilmiş gibi davranıyorsun
Oğlum, sinirini benden çıkarabilirsin
Ne olmak üzere, söyle bana
Olmak zorundaymış gibi hissediyorum

Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'
[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""
[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two

I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you
, 
you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby
[Chorus]
And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just likе this
What I would do to make you feel just like this"

I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)
[Pre-Chorus]
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do? Not grab your wrist?
[Chorus]
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
[Post-Chorus]
I could be a better boyfriend
[Verse 2]
I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways hе can't suffice
If I could give you some advicе
I would leave with me tonight"

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're out of sight
In my mind
[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us
[Verse 2]
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again"

I'm the strong one,
 
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains,
 
I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum,
 
I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back, what breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter"

Heard you moved out to South Carolina
Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye
[Verse 2]
I heard you found yourself a brand-new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful
, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'
[Chorus]
'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love"

A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive

She asked me where I's from
I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my 
Red Wings
 on the beach
[Chorus]
Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" 
(Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"""

Eu tenho que alimentar as ruas, minha pistola vai fazer sangrar pelas ruas

A vida nas ruas vai fazer com que você alcance Deus mais rápido (
Yeah, gangue

Não é uma F-150 normal, isso é uma Raptor, porra
Sem mentira, sou um mano da rua, não um rapper
O fuzil atingiu ele e ele virou uma putinha
Smith & Wesson, eu tô representando a Gangue 4L
A gente batizou mais manos do que o reverendo (Yeah)
Kappa Alpha, eu e a minha gangue, fazemos todas as etapas
Quem você tá verificando? O tiro dessa FN vai do Oriente até o West End (Gangue)

Yeah
Ouvi dizer que o Papi tá lá fora
E ele tá com o duplo-R conversível lá fora
Verifiquei o tempo e tá ficando realmente estranho lá fora
Eu vou lançar essa merda e fazer esses idiotas descerem igual um maldito—
Tipo de cara que não consegue me olhar nos olhos
Eu desprezo
Quando eu te vejo, é melhor deixar esse maldito orgulho de lado
Muitas vezes, muitas vezes, eu sobrevivi

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby"

Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good, but for me

Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff

Oh, God makes the good stuff

Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

Siento que puedo volar

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between
[Chorus]
A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm 
exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather

Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool
[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do"
2022,72,Oh My God,Adele,https://genius.com/Adele-oh-my-god-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight"

When I wake up, I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
, 
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot
[Chorus: WILLOW]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
[Verse 2: Tyler Cole & 
WILLOW
]
When I go to sleep, I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(
Meet me at our spot

Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work
[Verse 2]
Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you
[Chorus]
Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed
[Verse 3]
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me"

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
تو رستوان بار ""اَلدنز نشویل"" دیدمش
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
گفت که حدود یک مایل دورتر من رو در حال قدم زدن دید
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
پسر خاله ام ""بین"" فقط میخواست تلفنش رو ازش بگیره (تا ازم فیلم نگیره) و همین لبخندش رو از بین بر
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
گفت زیادی مست و دیوونه ام، نحوه رقصیدنم رو دوست نداره
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
گفتم: مجبور نیستی بهم ملحق بشی. گفت شانسشو امتحان میکنه
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
از وقتی که نقشه ام شکست خورد یه جورایی دیوونه بودم
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
یه جورایی گم شدم، و این چیزی بود که فهمیدم
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
دخترای مثل تو فقط میخوان من رو دور بزنن، دور بزنن، دور بزنن"

Take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waitin', takin' my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
[Verse 1]
I hope you don't think it's a little bit crazy
Sayin' this all so soon
But baby, it's the right time, knew it from the first time
That I laid eyes on you
It's okay, let 'em say what they want
They might think I should wait, but I don't
Nah, I don't wanna waste a minute
Girl, I want you in every single part of my world
[Chorus]
So take my hand, let me make you mine
I'm through waitin', takin' my time
Never felt like this before
Take my name and make it yours
[Verse 2]
I know I'm the last guy anybody think might
Ever be talking like this, yeah
But I can see my future in your eyes tonight
And taste forever on your lips
I'm like hold up a minute, don't go
Ain't no way I can take this slow, so
Go ahead and tell me I'm outta my mind
Or baby, just tell me yes"

King Von

Banger
Oh yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger
)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy"

G5 the flight, man, I'm way in the sky
She finna tell me ""No way"" and it's cap
Nigga, can't even see me, I'm way in the sky
G5 the flight, nigga way in the sky
G5 the flight, man, I'm way outta here
[Chorus]
G5 the flight
, 
nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of thе sewer
Chrome Hеart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship
, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid
[Verse 1]
Dirty the Fanta but make it in Canada
Bro get this money like it's my religion
It's gon' be a mad day, a sad day for any of these niggas
That try to compare whatever I did
Damn near touched a hundred, it just off the gig
I came out the jungle, they kidnapped a kid
I trap out a bando, spent ten on a crib
I look at the ocean to spot thirty M's
Pin it where I'm at, the city I'm in
I give you my fully, no matter where I'm in
Her hair touch her ass, she gon' think she Korean
You fuckin' me good, bitch, you helpin' me win
Niggas can't see me, ain't no competition
Too many bracelets, need a whole 'nother wrist
I'm never sober, don't think I'ma quit
I pop the 
E

Snowin' and blowin' up

Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet

The trouble with a heartbreak (Heartbreak, heartbreak)
[Verse 1]
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy ('Cause it ain't easy, no)
Don't let anyone tell ya they know what it's like
Mmh, when they say, ""Get out on this town, meet somebody new""
Get lost in a crowd, all I see is you
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy
[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt
Yеah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhеre her memory can't go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
(Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak)

Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to 
Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby Blue
 was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life
[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight
[Verse 2]
The other day right out of the 
Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game
But this ole heart just ain't the same
Hell, I can't even 
Give It Away"

You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile

You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind

Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about

Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with

Hung around long enough to catch a break

At teatime, everybody agrees

Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city

But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done
[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
[Verse 3]
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
[Chorus]
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home"

Seems you cannot be replaced

Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it

Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because
 you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her

She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night

You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer

Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

And this don't even feel like life

Prayin' just to stop the hurt

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know

Ele teve que tirar sua virgindade
Mas eu te deixei molhada como uma piscina

Ela quer ir no Highlight Room e exibi-lo
Tá com um corpo novo, garota, mostra isso aí
É Brasileira, eu sei que é mole
Tonificada e ela tem um pacote de seis
Parece que ela costumava jogar vôlei
American Express, você pode ter tudo
Código para o cofre, você pode ter tudo isso
Foda-se a sua página principal, qual é o seu Finsta? Eu quero conhecer a verdadeira você
Você começou a dançar pra pagar sua mensalidade, garota, eu quero saber pelo que você passou
Você quer uma boutique ou quer vender cabelo, apenas me diga do que você gosta

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true
[Verse 1: Payo Solís]
Nothing makes me laugh anymore
Only when I see the pictures and videos I have of you
I went out with someone else to forget you
And I had the perfume that you like
I light up to go to sleep
Because I sleep better if I dream that you're here
If you knеw that I wrote you
I haven't sent thе messages, they're all still there
Wow, how much its cost me
Maybe I did you a favor when I left your side
Drunk looking at your pictures, it hurts me to see that you did get better
You don't have grey days, your scars don't hurt anymore
And I'm wondering if I should tell you that
[Chorus: Payo Solis & 
Bad Bunny

All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride

Can't you see
 what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float

It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that old highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'

A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough

But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way
[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him
[Verse 2]
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights
[Chorus]
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him"

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up 
bushels
 of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
[Verse 2]
Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

Tipo, grrah, mantenha a real
Vadias agem estranho porque sabem que eu tenho grana (Caramba)
Elas falam demais, eu não dou a mínima
E eu ainda tô ganhando dinheiro, eu sei quem eu sou (Grrah)
Tô querendo sigilo, ele vai ver meu Insta (Grrah)
Se ele for esperto, ele vai agir como um fã (Caramba)
Você acha que é maior, eles te manipularam (Não, grrah)
Vadias são lеntas, então eu deixo passar

Vadias são lentas, então eu deixo passar
[Verso 1: Ice Spice]
E eu me apaixonei por um gângster (Tipo)
Então ele tatuou o meu nome (Caramba)
Mas eu não deixo ele vir p'ra minha casa (Grrah)
Então a gente se pega onde estivermos (Grrah)
Hoje em dia, eu me esquivo das câmeras
E eles enlouquecem por eu estar em panfletos
Ligam p'ra mim, mas sabem que eu não atendo (Por quê?)
Tô na quebrada como se eu fosse a princesa Diana (Grrah)
Eu sou gostosa porque eu como aveia (Huh)
Essas vadias não tiram nada de mim além de anotações
Quer ser eu, então ela faz as minhas poses
E o meu nome 'tá na boca dela, então aposto que ela vai engasgar (Vadia)
Para o namorado dela, eu sou a garota dos sonhos dele
Pensando em mim quando ele escova os dentes
Ele continua mandando mensagens, eu deixo no vácuo
Sou a vadia mais gostosa e eles sabem o que eu quero dizer (Sabem o que eu quero dizer)"

安物のウイスキーが俺の心を癒してくれる
ビーチタオルが物干し竿で揺れている
俺が君に88年型フォードに乗った君の父さんを思い出させるかい？
助手席ではラブラドールがくつろいでいる
君の髪についた砂が俺の目に入ってきて
ビーチのせいにしてくれ　大の男は泣かない
あの壊れた地下室のソファを覚えてるかい？
俺がラブソングを歌っていると君は
君の母さんがどうして指輪を質に入れて出て行ったかを教えてくれるんだ
すべて、すべて覚えているよ
[Chorus: Zach Bryan]
閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに
おかしな言葉が口から零れる
大人の男の心が壊れたときは
写真と過ぎ去った時間
君は飲んでるときだけそんな風に笑うんだ
したくないけど、そうしてしまうよ
君と過ごした夜の、一瞬一秒を思い出す
[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
あなたは心を癒すためなら何でも飲む
でも私の心はいつになったら癒してくれるの？
あなたといると、まるで夏の暑さに熱せられたコンクリートの上を歩いてるようで
二人の魂が出会うとき、それは地獄のように燃え上がる
あなたはあなたがいつも誓っていたような男にはなれないわ
でも、あの88年型フォードで歌うあなたのことを忘れない"

And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare
Well, God, if you're five-foot-three and you're three-hundred pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds

[Verso 1: Noah Kahan]
Estou me lembrando que prometi te esquecer agora
Mas está chovendo e eu estou ligando bêbado
E o meu remédio está afogando sua perspectiva
Então não estou levando nenhuma culpa
Será que ainda sou honesto? Será que ainda sou metade do homem que costumava ser?
Eu duvido, esqueça isso, tanto faz
E o sinal de discagem é tudo o que eu tenho
[Refrão: Noah Kahan & 
Post Malone
]
Eu não estou orgulhoso de todos os murros que já dei
No nome de alguém que não mais conheço
Pela vergonha de ser jovem, bêbado, e sozinho
Semáforos e um rádio transmissor
Eu não gosto de quando eles me jogaram no carro
Eu dei o seu nome como o meu contato de emergência
Querida, tocou e tocou, até os policiais acharam que você estava errada por desligar
Eu ligo bêbado, eu morrerei como um bêbado, eu morrerei por você
Eu morrerei
[Verso 2: Post Malone, 
Noah Kahan & Post Malone
]
Bebidas sendo servidas, não pude pará-las
Transformando outra dança lenta em 
um empurra-empurra
Enfio a minha cabeça, depois 
ouço a tranca e
Disse a eles que o meu primeiro carro era um Crown Vic
Falando sobre a última vez que eu estava no passageiro de um carro da polícia, onde me apaixonei
E minha cara na janela gelada, tentando ficar sóbrio e me desprender das algemas
E é sempre a mesma coisa de qualquer jeito"

Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo

Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más

And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow

To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy

That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

2023,95,I Wrote the Book,Morgan Wallen,https://genius.com/Morgan-wallen-i-wrote-the-book-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When it comes to hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book
[Verse 2]
If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book
[Chorus]
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
[Verse 3]
I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
[Bridge]
Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it
[Chorus]
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write"

Oh-oh (
Oh-oh

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Perdón, ya cogí otro avión
Aquí no vuelvo, no quiero otra decepción
Tanto que te las das de campeón
Y cuando te necesitaba diste tu peor versión
Sorry, baby, hace rato
Que yo debí botar ese gato
Una loba como yo no está pa' novato'

Una loba como yo no está pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verso 2: Shakira]
Esto es pa' que te mortifique', mastique' y trague', trague' y mastique'
Yo contigo ya no regreso, ni que me llores ni me supliquе'
Entendí que no es culpa mía quе te critiquen
Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique
Me dejaste de vecina a la suegra
Con la prensa en la puerta y la deuda en Hacienda
Te creíste que me heriste y me volviste más dura
Las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan"

Напряжение точно растет
Слишком пьян прямо сейчас
Время T, время T
Время T, время T, время T
[Куплет 1: Drake]
Чаепитие, как будто у меня есть чашка этого дерьма
Время игры в гольф в без четверти шесть
Я бы с удовольствием трахнул обычную суку
Известные шлюхи скучные, но они остаются на моём члене
Услышал твою новую хуйню, это смущает, дерьмо
Ты говоришь с копами о каком-то ебаном терапевте
Ты ведешь себя так, как будто обожаешь это американское дерьмо
Но, на самом деле, правда в том, что ты боишься шестёрки
Да, ты боишься шестёрки
Да, ты боишься шестёрки
Твой телохранитель отработал на удачу
Теперь ты хочешь стать наследником этого дерьма
Не говори со мной о сравнении, дерьмо
Или поговори с парнем с каким-нибудь высокомерным дерьмом
У нас в руках оружие террористов
Как телевизионные продюсеры  мы, гр, мы показываем это дерьмо
Она просит деньги у своих родителей и прочее дерьмо
Я сказал ей: «У меня нет наличных», а она сказала, что будет ждать стопку рэксов, на каком-нибудь арабском дерьме
Я достаю миллион и смотрю на это дерьмо
Мой член только что затвердел, потому что только что задел провод
У меня нет расписания, приходи и крутись с нами, серьёзно
Чел, нахуй это повествовательное дерьмо
Я уничтожаю цепи, которые купил у твоего босса
Мне похуй на всю эту культурную ценность
С тех пор как V нет рядом, они повесили Луи, они даже не носят это дерьмо
Не приходи к парню по поводу ремонта всякого дерьма
Не приходи к парню, чтобы сохранить дерьмо
Ты везучий, что Vogue подал в суд, потому что я был бы с Wassas в Париже и прочим дерьмом"

Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about"

When you’re not next to me, mhm

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God

助手席ではラブラドールがくつろいでいる
君の髪についた砂が俺の目に入ってきて
ビーチのせいにしてくれ　大の男は泣かない
あの壊れた地下室のソファを覚えてるかい？
俺がラブソングを歌っていると君は
君の母さんがどうして指輪を質に入れて出て行ったかを教えてくれるんだ
すべて、すべて覚えているよ

閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに

写真と過ぎ去った時間
君は飲んでるときだけそんな風に笑うんだ
したくないけど、そうしてしまうよ
君と過ごした夜の、一瞬一秒を思い出す

あなたは心を癒すためなら何でも飲む
でも私の心はいつになったら癒してくれるの？
あなたといると、まるで夏の暑さに熱せられたコンクリートの上を歩いてるようで

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even
 
smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes
[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night

You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

Зажгу косяк в этой суке
Метро, Метро, Метро, три раза
Йеа
[Куплет 1: Future]
Следуем кодексу, все эти шлюхи созданы для улиц
Засунул ей в нос, теперь её киска потечёт
Ссыкуны стуканули, не увидят света дня
Может, щелчка и не слышно, но слышно, как эти челы вопят
Все мои шлюшки под грибами, бля, все мои шлюшки под коксом
Кольцо двадцать карат, засунул пальцы ей глубоко в рот (А, а, а)
Если карат пропадёт, она удавится (А, а, а)
Я знаю, она сглотнёт, она в этом G.O.A.T. (А, а, а)
Freeband, на хуй, тащи бабки сюда
Мои стрелки в углу, стоят стаей
Она думает, что она экзотическая сучка и поэтому красива
Из-за такого дерьма тебя вынесут на районе, брр
И девиз у нас всё тот же
Шикую, будто выиграл игру за чемпионство
Ты знаешь, как эти шлюхи голодны, они трахнутся за статус
Подтянул её в банду, она трахнулась за цепь
Твоя девка в этой суке, она вертится на члене
У меня сироп в этой суке, тусим в этой суке
Мы принесли Перки в эту суку, наебашимсь в этой суке
Вся эта ювелирка на мне, детка, ну что ж, время поиграть
Зови подружку, сучка, мы трахнем их одновременно
Я на другом уровне, нет, мы не одной породы
Можешь взять ту малую, если её ещё не взял я (Йеа)"

Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give

New truck, big lift
Old roads, we've been
Tearin' up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
So, let's change that
[Chorus: Kane Brown]
Girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it

All night, no brakes
All tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed
Off-road, on me
Zero to a hundred fast
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, ""Hey, baby, slow it down, let's make it last""
You said, ""Where's the fun in that?"""

There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting

""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague

I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins

Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway

Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway"

Never stolen by nobody

And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus

Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're

In your head right now
While your world is spinning out

Let me hold you now

Я просто потратился, обычно не делаю такую хрень

Ниггер из Атланты, я живу, как Тед Тёрнер, типа того
На камеру, вышибаю челюсти, типа того
Я убрал её, выгнал со студии, типа того
Тихий убийца, я просто остаюсь спокойным с вами, мразями

Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight
[Verse 1]
I could be the one, or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? 
Call me hot, not pretty
[Refrain]
Baby, do you like this beat?
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me
[Pre-Chorus]
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
H-O-T-T-O-G-O"
2024,54,All I Want for Christmas Is You,Mariah Carey,https://genius.com/Mariah-carey-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-lyrics,"[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby"

[Chorus]
Slim thick, caramel skin
5'5"", this bitch a ten (Yeah)
Hair done, bills paid
Catch me slidin' in a Benz (Vyoom)

Ain't recruitin' no new friends
Louis bag filled with bands

Get it, Sexyy (Uh, uh), get it, Sexyy (Uh, uh)
Get it, Sexyy (Uh, uh), get it, Sexyy (Uh, uh)
[Verse 1]
Boy, you know this ass super fat (I ain't lyin', though)

He wanna kiss me all over my tats (Uh, uh, uh, uh, I might let him, though)
I'm so fuckin' sexy, they attack (All these niggas on go)
Feeling myself 'cause I know that I'm that (Yeah, bitch, I’m cold)
Ridin' through St. Louis in a Scat (And I can't go slow)
Bust down middle part, and I got it black (I'm a big fine ho)
Walkin' through the club lookin' like a snack (But you knew that though)"
2024,56,Made for Me,Muni Long,https://genius.com/Muni-long-made-for-me-lyrics,"[Intro]
Mm
Oh
[Verse 1]
The smell of your perfume
I thought I was immune
Lookin' around this room
Can't help but see the traces of you
This moment is surreal
I can't put into words how I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
Twin
Where have you been?
[Chorus]
Nobody knows me like you do (Nobody)
Nobody gon' love me quite like you (Nobody, yeah)
Can't even deny it, every time I try it
One look in my eyes, you know I'm lyin', lyin'
Body to body, skin to skin (I'm never gon' love like this)
I'm never gon' love like this again (Again, yeah)
You were made for me (Just for me)
Said you were made for me (Only for me, yeah, yeah)

Oh yeah, you were made for me"
2024,57,Vampire,Olivia Rodrigo,https://genius.com/Olivia-rodrigo-vampire-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
[Verse 2]
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better"
2024,58,Whatever She Wants,Bryson Tiller,https://genius.com/Bryson-tiller-whatever-she-wants-lyrics,"[Intro]
Nah, we just gettin' started
It's 
Slum Tiller, Volume 2
, nigga
My boy Tylian snapped on this shit
We got this motherfucker goin' crazy and we don't even know-
Can't see yo' at, peace, nigga, you know what time it is
Uh
[Chorus]
I'ma take her bougie ass to 
Rodeo
 and then let her pick up whatever she want
CC, Gucci, hit Bottega, whatever she want
She piss me off, somehow she still get whatever she want
Talking 'bout her nails, I'm finna nail her ass at home
Hit it in the shower, made her tell me where she want (Huh)
Like I'm singin' Mase, I made her tell me what she want
 (Huh, huh)
(Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh, wow)
[Verse 1]
She on a power trip again
I know pussy power got me buyin' shit again
Friends ain't jackin' me, you must be lyin' to your friends
They know I'm a beast, I wake the giants up again (Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh)
Shinin' once again
Ran it up, I told lil' mama, ""Slide in my DMs"" (Huh, uh)
Now I'm right back in, oh
Locked in
Shawty got that dress on so the block is hot again
Thick so when I hit it sound like Flocka adlibs (Baow-baow, baow-baow-baow)
Got her ass again
Then she got to trippin' over nothin' yet again
Got a nigga feelin' like a sucker yet again
Close off my emotion then I rush to let her in
Hurry up and let her in (Huh)"
2024,59,Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,Brenda Lee,https://genius.com/Brenda-lee-rockin-around-the-christmas-tree-lyrics,"[Verse]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""
[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way
[Saxophone Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"""
2024,60,Pretty Little Poison,Warren Zeiders,https://genius.com/Warren-zeiders-pretty-little-poison-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Every night, 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leanin' on old memories
And talkin' 'bout what used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet
[Chorus]
She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty littlе poison
[Verse 2]
Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants mе
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she's the one I'll pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need"

Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard 
Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

He pointed that headlight West

From South California
Talk about the desert and the

And how he bought an

J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh,

And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are

(
Ooh, Dunk Rock

[Chorus]
Fuck you mean?
Young Gunna Wunna back, callin' me splurge
Watch me jump right off the curb
Bentley Spur fly like a bird
Spin on the first and the third
Solid, I'm keepin' my word
Can't be my equal, I don't know what you heard
Crank up the foreign, I swerve
Keep me a stick if they purge

Ha, ha, ha, ha

Fuck you

Young Gunna Wunna, they workin' my nerves
I'm about to pour up some syrup
Fucking this bitch like a perv'
Smack from the back, grab her perm
Ice, the berg, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds
Can't take that dick, wait your turn
In my own lane, we can't merge
Suck with no hands, you can learn
Let's see how much you can earn
Watch me go big likе the Worm
And I ain't smokin' no sherm
I'm in this bitch with P Liity
QP, QP-ski
All of my bitches is prеtty, they showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'
I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion
I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains
Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'
Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'
Trappin', I made me a killin'
Look, I got everybody wishin'
I hope you play your position
I don't want nobody listenin'
I see the ho with precision
Get rich my only decision"

Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

Uh-huh

He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue

Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation"

This is where it ends
I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down
[Pre-Chorus]
Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more
[Chorus]
You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends
[Verse 2]
Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door"

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?

Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)

And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

I gotta tell you, baby, I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah

Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me

You're still right here, on my mind
You sure did a number on me

I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim
I've tried every last one of them
Ol' heartbreak bottles up on that shelf
But the burn don't work and the buzz don't help
Been taking these shots, shots, shots
80, 90, everything thеy've got
But the whiskey don't kill likе it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

There ain't no way I'm driving home
I'm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain't as strong

She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams
[Verse 2]
Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes
[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter
[Verse 3]
She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?
[Chorus]
I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen

With every wall I built, she saw a canvas

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance

Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
