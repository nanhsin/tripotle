Didn't I hear you cry this morning?
Didn't I feel you weep?
Teardrops flowin' down on me
Like rivers in my sleep
In my dream of laughter
You came creepin' with your fears
Tellin' me your sorrow
In the tracings of your tears
[Chorus]
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no
[Verse 2]
Didn't I hear your voice this morning?
Didn't you call my name?
I heard you whisper softly
But the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness
I came shinin' like the sun
Waiting for the laughter
But the laughter never comes"

Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, its only seed
[Verse 2]
It's the heart, afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying
That never learns to live
[Verse 3]
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"

I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read
[Chorus]
If you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad"

In cars

Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me, please
If I open my door?

About leaving tonight

Deeper than any forest primeval

You'll send showers in the springs
We`ll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings
Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you

Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong
[Verse 2]
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""
[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man
[Verse 3]
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again"

1980,90,"""September Morn""",Neil Diamond,https://genius.com/Neil-diamond-september-morn-lyrics,"Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door
Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again
September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In the corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before"

And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air
Hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand
I said, love's easier when it's far away
We sat and watched the distant light
We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
There's a boat on the line
Where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I
Are like strangers, a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, it's harder now, we're far away
We only read you when you write
We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor

You've got to leave, just get away

Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one?
I wonder who's crying now?

So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear

I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all

One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand

That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turned around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door"

[Verse 1]
An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
[Verse 2]
A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline—
a thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

On a blue, blue day

I'll be far away

Holdin' back the pain

They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal

Doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed

There's a weapon
That we must use
In our defense
Silence
When you look at them
Look right through them
That's when they'll disappear
That's when we'll be feared

Doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
Doesn't matter anyway

1982,64,You Could Have Been with Me,Sheena Easton,https://genius.com/Sheena-easton-you-could-have-been-with-me-lyrics,"You're the seventh son of the seventh son
Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else
You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul
But you cannot make him think
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You can tell him the date of departure
Exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there
But he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely..."

Said to myself, ""What's it all about?""
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic, you can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know you're the one who can put out the fire

That gentle persuader is gonna catch up with your heart
Make you a dreamer

Right when a man's doing all that he planned
And he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver a shot that will shiver him
Driving him down to his knees
Make him start giving
Living
Living again
Well, it's your mind
That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast

Turning
They're turning around"

Tried to let you go

I need you so
But you don't belong to me

What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain
[Verse 2]
And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one
No one can replace
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'

And the good things will never change

Yesterday's moves
Don't stay in the grooves

Was for yesterday's time
And the future's not ours to see
But there's some things that always will be

You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say

Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?

When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?"

Sirens in my head
My whole life spins into a frenzy
Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M
It's two A.M., the fear has gone
(It's two A.M., the fear has gone)
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm
(I'm sitting here waitin', the gun's still warm)
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances
Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy
Help, I'm steppin' into the 
Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?
Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone

You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words, they lie

If you wanna leave, then why don't you say it?
Your love has gone anyway

I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on

I hear the drums echoin' tonight

I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waitin' there for you""

The wild dogs cry out in the night

Frightened of this thing that I've become"

Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say,  ""What have I got to lose?""

And, honey, I say, little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class"

And many fantasies were learned

But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know
[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means
[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure
[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe
[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?
[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
 could be the difference that it makes
[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do
[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means"

Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me

An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother

Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry"

What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?

There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me

It means forever, and that's a mighty long time

The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe

Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)

The world you're living in

Dropped it on the floor

""If you have to ask, you can't afford it"" lingerie
She threw him bread
And said make me scream

Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said, ""I need a man's man, baby""
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head"

And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart

(They begin to play the opening to ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.)
Audition Judge: Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please?
(Town Square)
(Marty and Jennifer are sitting on a bench near the Clock Tower.)
Election Van: Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.
Marty: I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Jennifer: Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
Marty: Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.
Jennifer: But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.
Marty: Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Jennifer: That's good advice, Marty.
Marty: Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, ""Get out of here, kid, you got no future."" I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.
Jennifer: C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Marty: (spots a really sweet looking Truck.) Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.
Jennifer: Stop it.
Marty: What?
Jennifer: Does your mom know about tomorrow night?
Marty: No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.
Jennifer: She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Marty: Well, she's not doing a very good job.
(They go to kiss but a woman shoves a flyer in their faces.)
Woman: Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
Marty: Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. (drops a quarter into her collection tin.)
Woman: Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.
Marty: Right.
Woman: (walks off) Save the clock tower.
Marty: Where were we?
Jennifer: Right about here.
(They kiss right as Jennifer's Dad drives up.)
Jennifer's Dad: Jennifer.
Jennifer: It's my dad.
Marty: Right.
Jennifer: I've gotta go.
Marty: I'll call you tonight.
Jennifer: I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. (writes the number on the back of the Clock Tower flyer.) Bye.
(Marty's House)
Marty: Perfect, just perfect.
(Marty arrives in time to see a Tow Truck driving up with what's left of his Dad's Car. Inside Biff Tannen is griping at George McFly, Marty's father. George is a skinny man, and very nerdy.)
Biff: I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed.
George: Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blind spot before when I would drive it. (spots Marty) Hi, son.
Biff: But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
George: Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
Biff: My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
George: Uh?
Biff: And where's my reports?
George: Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? (George doesn't say anything.) Would you?
George: Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?
Biff: Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. (George looks down and Biff smacks his head.) Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. (Goes to the fridge to get a beer.) I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead? Say hi to your mom for me. (leaves)
George: (turns to see Marty's disappointed expression) I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.
Marty: The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?
George: I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.
(Dinner Table - Later)
(The whole family is having dinner. George is working on his reports and watching TV. David and Linda, Marty's siblings are there as well. David is dressed in his work clothes, a fast food restaurant outfit.)
George: Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
David: He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.
(Marty's mother, Loraine, enters and drops a cake onto the table. She's a plump woman who tends to drink somewhat.)
Lorraine: Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.
Marty: Uncle Jailbird Joey?
David: He's your brother, Mom.
Linda: Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.
Lorraine: We all make mistakes in life, children.
David: God dammit, I'm late.
Lorraine: David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.
David: C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. (kisses George's head.) Woo, time to change that oil.
(George laughs at that.)
Linda: Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.
Lorraine: I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.
Linda: Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
Lorraine: I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Linda: Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.
Lorraine: Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.
Linda: That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.
Lorraine: It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Linda: Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
Lorraine: What was it, George, bird watching?
George: (looks up from the TV) What Lorraine, what?
Lorraine: Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.
Linda: Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.
Lorraine: No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
(Bedroom - 1:00 am)
(Marty's asleep in his clothes. The phone rings, and Marty wakes up and answers it.)
Doc: (on phone) Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Marty: Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.
Doc: Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Marty: Um, yeah, I'm on my way.
(Twin Pines Mall)
(Marty shows up but doesn't see Doc. He walks over to Doc's dog, Einstein.)
Marty: Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc?
(Suddenly the back of an 18-wheeler opens up and Doc drives slowly out in the Delorean.)
Doc: Marty, you made it.
Marty: Yeah.
Doc: Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Marty: Um, well it's a Delorean, right?
Doc: Bare with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.
Marty: Doc, is that a de…
Doc: Never mind that now, never mind that now.
Marty: Alright, I'm ready.
Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. (gestures for Einstein to get into the car) C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.
Marty: Whoa, whoa, okay.
Doc: Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.
Marty: Right check, Doc.
Doc: Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
Marty: You have this thing hooked up to the car?
(The doc picks up a remote control device.)
Doc: Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. (The car heads straight for them picking up speed all the while. It hits 88 MPH just as it reaches them and it disappears. Leaving behind fire track marks on the pavement.) Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds.
Marty: Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.
Doc: Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Marty: Where the hell are they.
Doc: The appropriate question is, 'when the hell are they?' Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.
Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of the Delorean? Doc: The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out! (he shoves Marty out of the way just as the car reappears. It's covered in ice.)
Marty: What, what is it hot?
Doc: It's cold, damn cold. (Doc opens the car door with his foot.) Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.
Marty: He's alright.
Doc: He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. (leans into the car and points out the time circuit) First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tells you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You input the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.
Marty: What, I don't get what happened.
Doc: That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcelain was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. (motions to the flux capacitor.)This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
Marty: The flux capacitor.
Doc: It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
Marty: This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Doc: Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.
Marty: Uh, plutonium, (lowers the camera) wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?
Doc: Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. (Marty picks the camera up again) No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Marty: Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?
Doc: Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.
Marty: Jesus.
Doc: Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.
(A few minutes later both Doc and Marty are fully clothed in radiation suits. Doc injects a rod of plutonium into the Delorean, then removes his helmet.)
Doc: Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. (goes to climb in the Delorean) Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.
Marty: The future, it's where you're going?
Doc: That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
Marty: Uh, Doc.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: Uh, look me up when you get there.
Doc: Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of? I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back? One pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. (Einstein begins to whine) What is it Einy? (Spots the Libyans in their van) Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Who, who?
Doc: Who do you think, (points) the Libyans.
Marty: Holy shit.
Doc: Unroll their fire.
Marty: Doc, wait.
(The Libyans corner Doc and shoot him.)
Marty: No!! Bastards!! (They go after him and he jumps in the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go. Go. (they follow)
Marty: C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. (floors the gas, and as soon as the car reaches 88 MPH he is sent back to 1955.)
Marty: Ahh. Ahh.
(Hill Valley Outskirts - 1955)
(Marty crashes into Old Man Peabody's Barn. The Peabody's wake up and rush out to the barn.)
Mother: Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?
Father: Looks like a airplane, without wings.
Son: That ain't no airplane, look.
(Holds up his alien comic, which shows an alien craft that looks a lot like the Delorean. They all hold their breath as the door opens and Marty gets out. His radiation hood is over his face, and they think he's an alien.)
Mother & Father: Ahh.
Father: Children. (they high tale it out of the barn.)
Marty: Listen, woah. (he trips but gets back up.) Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.
(Marty opens the barn door.)
Son: It's already mutated intro human form, shoot it.
Father: Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. (Marty ducks and scrambles back into the Delorean. He takes off running over a pine on the way.) My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.
(Road)
(Marty spots a sign for the neighborhood that he lives in. It's just about to be built.)
Marty: Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. (stops a car that's driving by) Woah, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
Woman: Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.
(They quickly drive off.)
Marty: Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.
(Hill Valley)
(Marty wanders around and spots another Election Van driving around.)
Election Van: Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...
(A man throws a newspaper away and Marty picks it up and sees the date as November 5th, 1955.)
Marty: This has gotta be a dream.
(He spots a coffee shop and goes in.)
(Coffee Shop)
Lou: Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?
Marty: What?
Lou: What's with the life preserver?
(Marty looks down at his jacket vest.)
Marty: I just wanna use the phone.
Lou: Yeah, it's in the back.
Marty: (goes and looks through the white pages in the phone book) Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. (He tries calling but there's no answer. So he goes over to the bar.) Do you know where 1640 Riverside…
Lou: Are you gonna order something, kid?
Marty: Yeah, gimme a Tab.
Lou: Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Marty: Right, gimme a Pepsi free.
Lou: You wanna a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.
Marty: Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?
Lou: Without any sugar.
(He gives Marty a cup of coffee and takes the money. Suddenly a younger Biff Tannen walks in.)
Biff: Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.
(Marty turns, thinking they're talking to him.)
Marty: Biff.
(Biff ignores Marty and continues talking to the guy next to him.)
Biff: Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
(Marty looks over and there sits his father.)
George: Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?
Biff: Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?
George: Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday…
Biff: Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?
George: Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Biff: Uh, no, no, no, no. (Notices that Marty is watching them.) What are you looking at, butt-head?
Guy 1: Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.
Biff: Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?
George: Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Biff: Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.
George: Okay.
Biff: I don't wanna see you in here again.
George: Yeah, alright, bye-bye. (goes back to eating his cereal, but sees Marty still watching him.) What?
Marty: You're George McFly.
George: Yeah, who are you?
Goldie: Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?
George: Well, they're bigger than me.
Goldie: Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Lou: Watch it, Goldie.
Goldie: No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.
Marty: That's right, he's gonna be mayor.
Goldie: Yeah, I'm…mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.
Lou: A colored mayor, that'll be the day.
Goldie: You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
Lou: Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.
Goldie: Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.
(Marty smiles at that, and turns back to talk to George, but he's gone. He looks outside and sees George riding off on his bike, and he runs outside.)
Marty: Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
(Street)
(Marty spots his dad's bike leaning up against a tree, and looks up to see his father in the tree looking through a pair of binoculars. He looks to see what his father is looking at and sees a half-undressed girl through a bedroom window.)
Marty: He's a peeping tom. (George falls out of the tree and is about to be hit by an oncoming car.) Dad! (Marty shoves him out of the way and gets hit by the car himself.)
Sam: (to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.
(Bedroom)
(Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.)
Marty: Mom, is that you?
Lorraine: There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
Marty: I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.
Lorraine: Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.
Marty: 1955? (he jerks up in bed just as Loraine turns on the light.) You're my mo…you're my mo….
Lorraine: My name's Lorraine. Lorraine Baines.
(She sits down on the opposite bed.)
Marty: Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.
Lorraine: Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.
Marty: Ah, where're my pants?
Lorraine: (points) Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Marty: Calvin. Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Lorraine: Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
Marty: Actually, people call me Marty.
Lorraine: Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. (she gets up and goes to sit next to him) Do you mind if I sit here?
Marty: No, fine, no , good, fine, good.
Lorraine: That's a big bruise you have there.
Marty: Ah. (he backs away from her touch and falls off the bed.)
(Lorraine's mother calls out from downstairs.)
Stella: Loraine, are you up there?
Lorraine: God, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.
(She throws his pants to him, and he catches them dropping the blanket in the process. She grins at him before ducking out of the room.)
(Downstairs)
(A few minutes later Marty is walking down the stairs with Lorraine and her mother.)
Stella: So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Marty: Excuse me.
Stella: Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.
Marty: Uh, coast guard.
Stella: Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.
Sam: What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.
Stella: Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
(Marty leans down to talk to Joey.)
Marty: So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.
Stella: Yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Marty: Well, uh, listen, uh, I really…
Lorraine: (jerks Marty down into the chair next to her.) Sit here, Marty.
Stella: Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
(Sam pulls the TV into the doorway of the dining room.)
Sam: Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.
Lorraine: Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?
Marty: Well yeah, you know we have two of them.
Milton: Wow, you must be rich.
Stella: Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.
Marty: Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.
Milton: What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.
Marty: Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.
Milton: What's a rerun?
Marty: You'll find out.
Stella: You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
Marty: (glances at Lorraine) Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Stella: Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.
Marty: You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Yet.
Stella: Oh.
Marty: Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
Sam: It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.
Marty: A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
Sam: Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Lorraine: Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughtta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
Stella: That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.
Marty: Well gee, I don't know.
Lorraine: And he could sleep in my room. (she grabs Marty's thigh under the table.)
Marty: (jumps up) I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. (leaves)
Stella: He's a very strange young man.
Sam: He's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.
(Doc's House)
(Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.)
Marty: Doc?
(Doc opens the door fully now. He's got some strange contraption on his head. He pulls Marty into the living room.)
Doc: Don't say a word.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything, anything about you.
Marty: Listen, Doc.
Doc: Quiet.
Marty: Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.
Doc: Don't tell me anything.
(Doc puts a suction cup on Marty's forehead.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help…
Doc: Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?
Marty: Yeah, exactly.
Doc: Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?
Marty: No.
Doc: Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?
Marty: (he pulls the suction cup off his forehead) Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
Doc: (grabs Marty's shoulders) My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. (takes off the contraption.)
Marty: Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Doc: Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.
Marty: Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.
(Doc takes the picture with a pair of tongs and looks at it.)
Doc: Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.
(He tosses the photo back at Marty.)
Marty: I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.
Doc: So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?
Marty: Ronald Reagan.
Doc: Ronald Reagan? The actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? (he grabs some papers and runs outside towards his workshop) I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.
Marty: Whoa, wait, Doc.
Doc: And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.
Marty: Look, you gotta listen to me.
Doc: I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. (he slams the workshop door in Marty's face.)
Marty: No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.
(Doc swings the door open and looks at Marty with astonishment.)
(Workshop)
(Marty is rewinding the video he shot of the time travel test with 1985 Doc.)
Marty: Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.
Doc: After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. (He holds up a crude drawing of the flux capacitor.)
Marty: Flux capacitor.
Doc: It works, (laughs), it works. I finally invent something that works.
Marty: Bet your ass it works.
Doc: Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.
Marty: Okay Doc, this is it.
(1985 Doc pops up on the screen.)
1985 Doc: Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind…
Doc: Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.
1985 Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of…
Doc: Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
Marty: Well, this is a radiation suit.
Doc: Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.
Marty: whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc.
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity…
Doc: What did I just say?
(Marty rewinds the tape and plays it again.)
1985 Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Doc: One point twenty-one gigawatts! One point twenty-one gigawatts! Great Scott. (runs out of the workshop.)
Marty: (calling after him) What the hell is a gigawatt?
(House)
(Doc is now sitting in an armchair.)
Doc: How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. (he picks up a photo and starts talking to it.) Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.
(Marty comes in.)
Marty: Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.
Doc: I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
Marty: Whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.
Doc: Is she pretty?
Marty: Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. (shows Doc what Jennifer wrote on the back of the Clock Tower flier.) That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.
Doc: Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
Marty: What did you say?
Doc: A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.
Marty: We do now.
(He holds out the flier and Doc takes it and reads it.)
Doc: This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.
Marty: Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.
Doc: Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?
Marty: Yeah, sure, okay.
Doc: Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Marty: (guiltily) Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.
Doc: Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. (Marty gives it to him) Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
Marty: His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.
Doc: Erased from existence.
(School)
(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.)
Marty: Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
Doc: Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.
Marty: This sounds pretty heavy.
Doc: Weight has nothing to do with it.
(Hallway)
Doc: Which one's your pop?
Marty: That's him.
(Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in the butt.)
George: Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.
Doc: Maybe you were adopted.
George: Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?
Strickland: McFly.
Marty: That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Strickland: Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?
George: No.
Doc: What did your mother ever see in that kid?
Marty: I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car…(pause)…hit me with the car.
Doc: That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.
(Marty walks over to George.)
Marty: Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.
George: Yeah.
Marty: Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. (he takes George over to where Lorraine is at her locker.) Lorraine.
Lorraine: (surprised) Calvin.
Marty: I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
George: (tries to make a move on her) Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.
Lorraine: (to Marty) How's your head?
Marty: Well uh, good, fine.
Lorraine: Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? (the bell rings) I'm sorry I have to go. (to her friends as she passes by Doc) Isn't he a dream boat?
Marty: Doc, she didn't even look at him.
Doc: This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.
Marty: Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Doc: Precisely.
Marty: Whoa, this is heavy.
Doc: There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?
Marty: What?
Doc: The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social…
Marty: What, well you mean like a date?
Doc: Right.
Marty: What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?
Doc: Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are there common interests? What do they like to do together?
Marty: Nothing.
Doc: Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Marty: Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.
Doc: Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
(Lunchroom)
(Marty sits down across from George at a table. George is writing in a notebook.)
Marty: George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Loraine. What are you writing?
George: Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.
Marty: Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. (he reaches for the notebook, but George jerks it back.)
George: Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.
Marty: Why not?
George: Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
Marty: (thinks about his band audition) Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Loraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.
George: Really.
Marty: Oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.
George: What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Marty: Who?
George: (points over at Lorraine's table.) Biff.
(Biff is sitting at Lorraine's table, and he's trying to grope her.)
Biff: C'mon, c'mon.
Lorraine: Leave me alone.
Biff: You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.
Lorraine: (she slaps him) Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.
Biff: Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Lorraine: Get your meat hooks off of me.
Marty: You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, (Biff stands up and he's at least a foot taller than Marty) uh please.
Biff: So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a… (spots Strickland over Marty's shoulder) since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.
(Street)
(George is walking home and Marty catches up to him.)
Marty: George.
George: Why do you keep following me around?
Marty: Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
George: But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
Marty: Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.
George: Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.
(He runs inside his house and shuts the door behind him.)
Marty: (to himself) Science Fiction Theater.
(George's Room - Night)
(Marty arrives in his radiation suit and helmet. He places headphones on George's head as he sleeps, and then pops a Van Halen tape into the walkman and presses play. George wakes up with a jerk, holding his head.)
George: Who are you?
(Marty presses play again and George falls silent.)
Marty: Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
(George turns and looks at the cover of a book that's by his head, and the alien looks almost exactly like Marty does in his radiation suit.)
(Gas Station - Day)
(Marty is trying to open up a bottle of Coke. George runs up. He's very disheveled.)
George: Marty. Marty. Marty.
Marty: Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?
George: I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Loraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it.
Marty: Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the café. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?
(George takes the bottle of Coke and opens it for Marty. They begin walking over to the Café.)
George: Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain.
Marty: Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
George: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Marty: Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
George: Okay, but I don't know what to say.
Marty: Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.
George: Nothing's coming to my mind.
Marty: Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.
George: What, what?
Marty: Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?
George: I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.
Marty: Yeah okay.
George: Oh.
Marty: Let's go.
George: Oh.
(Coffee Shop)
(They enter the coffee shop.)
Marty: Will you take care of that?
George: Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.
Lorraine: What?
George: Oh, what I meant to day was…
Lorraine: Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
George: Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and you're my density. I mean, I'm your destiny.
Lorraine: Oh.
(Biff and his friends walk in.)
Biff: Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?
George: Well, Biff.
Biff: Alright, punk, now…
Marty: Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?
(Marty runs out.)
Lorraine: That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.
(Outside)
(Marty runs over to a kid who's on a scooter.)
Marty: Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Kid: Hey.
Marty: I'll get it back to you, alright?
(Marty breaks off the top part of the scooter, leaving a 1955 version of a skateboard. He takes off on it.)
Kid: You broke it. Wow, look at him go.
Biff: Let's get him.
Girl: What's that thing he's on?
Boy: It's a board with wheels.
Lorraine: He's an absolute dream.
(Biff and his friends hop into Biff's car and take off after Marty. They manage to catch up to him. He's on his board right in front of their car. He holds on to the hood since he can't get away.)
Marty: Ah. Whoa.
(Biff spots a manure truck and heads straight for it.)
Biff: I'm gonna ram him.
(Marty manages to get out of the way, and Biff heads straight for the manure truck.)
Biff & his friends: Shit.
(They hit the truck and it dumps a load of manure into the car and onto them. Marty walks over to the kid he borrowed the 'skateboard' from and gives it back to him.)
Marty: Thanks a lot, kid.
Biff: I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
(Everyone is standing outside of the Coffee Shop talking about what just happened.)
Girlfriend #1: Where does he come from?
Girlfriend #2: Yeah, where does he live?
Lorraine: I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
(Doc's Workshop)
(Doc is watching the video of 1985 Doc. Marty walks in and sees him.)
1985 Doc: My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Marty: Doc.
Doc: Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.
Marty: Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.
Doc: Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
Marty: You don't understand.
Doc: I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.
Marty: You're…you're right.
Doc: Let me show you my plan for sending you home. (Walks over to a very nice model of the town of Hill Valley.) Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.
Marty: Its good.
Doc: Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the Clock Tower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at 10:04 PM lightning will strike the Clock Tower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. (Marty releases the car. It races down the main street in the model. When it hits the 'wire' Doc has hooked up it accelerates. It flies off the table in flames and lands in a pile of rags, setting them on fire.) Huhh. (Doc quickly races to put the fire out.)
Marty: You instill me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Doc: Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your Pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?
Marty: Uh, I think so.
Doc: What did she say?
(There's a knock at the door before Marty can answer. Doc goes to see who it is.)
Doc: It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
(They cover the Delorean with a sheet and Doc opens the door. Lorraine walks in a little nervously until she spots Marty.)
Lorraine: Hi, Marty.
Marty: Uh, Loraine. How did you know I was here?
Lorraine: I followed you.
Marty: Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.
Lorraine: Hi.
Marty: Hello.
Lorraine: Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.
Marty: Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?
Lorraine: No, not yet.
Marty: What about George?
Lorraine: George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?
Marty: Yeah.
(Saturday Morning)
(George's Backyard)
(George is hanging up laundry.)
George: I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
Marty: Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.
George: Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.
Marty: Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be.
George: I'm gonna be at the dance.
Marty: Right, and where am I gonna be?
George: You're gonna be in the car with her.
Marty: Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.
George: Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Marty: Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
George: Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her…
Marty: No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say…(pause while he waits for George to say something) …your line, George.
George: Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. (pause) Do you really think I oughta swear?
Marty: Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Loraine live happily ever after.
George: Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.
Marty: George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.
(Saturday Night)
(Main Street)
(Doc and Marty are setting up the Delorean for the trip back to 1985.)
Radio: This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.
Doc: Are you sure about this storm?
Marty: When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.
Doc: You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.
Marty: I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future…
Doc: No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.
(Coffee Shop)
(Marty is writing Doc a letter.)
Marty: Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.
(Main Street)
Cop: Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?
Doc: Oh, just a little weather experiment.
Cop: What you got under here?
Doc: Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.
Cop: You got a permit for that?
Doc: Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.
(While Doc isn't looking Marty slips the letter into the pocket of his jacket, then he leaves to pick up Lorraine.)
(School Parking Lot)
(Marty and Lorraine arrive at the dance. Marty's very nervous.)
Marty: Do you mind if we park for a while?
Lorraine: That's a great idea. I'd love to park.
Marty: Huh?
Lorraine: Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.
Marty: (shocked) What?
Lorraine: (takes her jacket off, and her dress shows a bit of cleavage) Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?
Marty: (looks away) No no. (looks back to see Lorraine take a drink of alcohol from a flask she had in her purse.) Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?
Lorraine: I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Marty: Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.
Lorraine: Why not?
Marty: Because, you might regret it later in life.
Lorraine: Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.
(He goes to take a drink but spits it out when she lights a cigarette.)
Marty: Jesus, you smoke too?
Lorraine: Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
(The Dance)
(George is off to the side dancing by himself.)
Marvin Barry: We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.
(The Parking Lot)
Lorraine: Marty, why are you so nervous?
Marty: Loraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
Lorraine: Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.
Marty: Ah well, sort of.
Lorraine: I think I know exactly what you mean.
Marty: You do?
Lorraine: You know what I do in those situations?
Marty: What?
Lorraine: I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Marty: Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.
Lorraine: Someone's coming.
(Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.)
Biff: You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Lorraine: Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.
Biff: Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Lorraine: Stop it.
Biff: C'mon.
Marty: Leave her alone, you bastard.
Biff: You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.
(The guys drag Marty off.)
(Back of the Auditorium)
(Biff's guys run up and dump Marty in the trunk of a car.)
Guy 1: Let's put him in there.
Guy 2: Yeah.
Guy 1: That's for messing up my hair.
(They slam the trunk shut and one of the band members gets out of the car.)
Starlighter: What the hell you doing to my car?
Guy 2: Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.
Marvin Barry: Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.
Guy 1: Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? (they run off)
Marty: (in the trunk) C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.
Marvin Barry: Lorenzo, where're you keys?
Marty: The keys are in the trunk.
Marvin Barry: Say that again.
Marty: I said the keys are in here.
(Parking Lot)
(George runs out to the car where Loraine is and jerks the car door open.)
George: Hey you, get your damn hands off…(sees that it's BifF) oh.
Biff: I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
Lorraine: George, help me, please.
Biff: Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.
George: No, Biff, you leave her alone.
Biff: Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.
(Biff grabs George's arm and twists it.)
Lorraine: Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.
(Back of the Auditorium)
Marvin Barry: Give me a hand, Lorenzo. (Pops the trunk open) Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.
(Marty quickly climbs out.)
Marty: Who's are these? (tosses the keys to one of the guys)
Starlighter: Thanks, thanks a lot.
(Parking Lot)
Lorraine: You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.
(Biff shoves her down, and George watches in horror. George then doubles up his fist when Biff isn't looking and when Biff looks back George decks him. Biff falls down and is out cold. George can't believe what he did. Then he holds out a hand to Loraine.)
George: Are you okay?
(Lorraine takes his hand and he helps her up. They walk off into the dance.)
Girlfriend: Who is that guy.
Boyfriend: That's George McFly.
Girlfriend: That's George McFly?
Marty: Excuse me.
(Main Street)
(The wind picks up and thunder rolls.)
Doc: The storm.
(Back of the Auditorium)
(The guys from the band are still outside trying to figure out what to do since Marvin's hand is busted up.)
Marty: Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Starlighter: Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.
Marty: Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
Marvin Barry: Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.
(The Dance)
(Marty is up on stage with the Band playing the guitar. They're playing 'Earth Angel'.)
Marvin Barry: This is for all you lovers out there.
Lorraine: George, aren't you gonna kiss me?
George: I, I don't know.
(This kid cuts in on George and Loraine. Marty begins to disappear.)
Kid: Scram, McFly.
Starlighter: (to Marty) Hey boy, are you alright?
Marty: I can't play.
Lorraine: George. George.
Marty: George.
George: (to kid) Excuse me. (he shoves the kid out of the way and kisses Loraine.)
(Marty comes back and both his brother and sister show up in the picture again.)
Marvin Barry: Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.
Marty: Uh, well, I gotta go.
Marvin Barry: C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.
Marty: Something that really cooks. (to audience) Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. (to band) Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. (they begin to play 'Johnny Be Good')
Boyfriend: Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.
Girlfriend: George you ever think of running for class president?
(Marvin goes backstage and makes a phone call.)
Marvin Barry: (into phone) John, John, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Barry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.
(Marty finishes the song with a wild guitar solo. Everyone stops dancing and stares at him.)
Marty: I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.
(Side Door)
Marty: Lorraine.
Lorraine: Marty, that was very interesting music.
Marty: Uh, yeah.
Lorraine: I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.
Marty: Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two.
Lorraine: I have a feeling too.
Marty: Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Lorraine: Marty, will we ever see you again?
Marty: I guarantee it.
George: Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it.
Marty: Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids (Lorraine blushes) and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.
George: Okay.
(Marty leaves)
Lorraine: Marty, such a nice name.
(Main Street)
Doc: Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. (Marty shows up.) You're late, do you have no concept of time?
Marty: Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.
Doc: What?
Marty: He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.
Doc: Never?
Marty: No, why, what's a matter?
Doc: Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
Marty: Right.
Doc: Well, I guess that's everything.
Marty: Thanks.
Doc: Thank you. In about thirty years.
Marty: I hope so.
Doc: Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.
Marty: Right.
(Doc puts his hands in his pockets. He feels the letter and pulls it out. He looks at it then holds it out to Marty.)
Doc: What's the meaning of this.
Marty: You'll find out in thirty years.
Doc: It's about the future, isn't it?
Marty: Wait a minute.
Doc: It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.
Marty: Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.
Doc: No, I refuse to except the responsibility.
(Doc rips up the letter.)
Marty: In that case, I'll tell you strait out.
(But before Marty can tell Doc what's going to happen in the future lightening strikes a tree and a limb falls down and unplugs the cable that runs from the clock tower to the cable in the middle of the street.)
Doc: Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Marty: Right, I got it.
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: Doc.
(Doc climbs up to the top of the Clock Tower so they can fix the cable.)
Doc: C'mon, c'mon let's go.
Marty: (ties the rope to the cable) Alright, take it up, go. Doc.
(Doc lifts the cable up. Since Doc is at the top of the Clock Tower he can't hear what Marty is saying.)
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
Doc: Huh?
Marty: I have to tell you about the future.
(Doc almost falls off the Clock Tower.)
Doc: Ahh.
Marty: On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.
Doc: Ohh, no.
Marty: No, Doc.
Doc: Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.
Marty: Yeah.
(Down the Street)
(Marty reaches the white line, and stops the car. He hops out and attaches the hook to the back of the car and then climbs back into the Delorean.)
Marty: Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. (the car dies) No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. (the car starts. The alarm goes off and Marty floors it.)
(Main Street)
(Doc just manages to get the cables hooked up correctly as the Delorean comes rushing down the street. Just as he gets the cables together the lightening strikes and passes through the cable and he's thrown back.)
Doc: Ahh.
(In the Delorean)
Marty: Doc.
(Main Street)
(Marty hits 88 MPH and disappears into the future.)
Doc: Yeah!!
(Main Street - 1985)
Red: Crazy drunk drivers.
Marty: Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. (the car has died again) No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.
(Marty takes off running and reaches the Mall just as his other self sees Doc get shot.)
Marty #1: No, bastards.
(The other Marty jumps into the Delorean and takes off.)
Libyan: Go.
(Our Marty watches as the Delorean hits 88 MPH and takes off into the past. He runs over to Doc who is laying, unmoving, on the ground.)
Marty: Doc, Doc. Oh, no. (The Doc sits up behind him. Marty turns and sees that Doc is alive.) You're alive. (Doc pulls down zipper on his jump suit to reveal a bullet proof vest.) Bullet proof vest? How did you know? (Doc pulls out the letter that has been taped back together.) I never got a chance to tell you. What about all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum?
Doc: Well, I figured, what the hell.
(Marty's House)
(Doc has dropped Marty off.)
Marty: About how far ahead are you going?
Doc: About 30 years, it's a nice round number.
Marty: Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.
Doc: I will.
Marty: Take care.
Doc: You too.
Marty: Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.
Doc: You bet.
(Doc drives off and Marty heads inside his house.)
(The Next Day)
(Marty wakes up in his bed.)
Marty: What a nightmare.
(He gets up and walks into the living room and does a double take. Everything has completely changed. Everything is now upscale. Linda and David are both dressed for work. They're wearing suits.)
Linda: Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
David: Linda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Linda: Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?
David: I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
Marty: What the hell is this?
Linda: Breakfast.
David: What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.
Marty: Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.
David: Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?
Marty: Yeah.
(Lorraine and George walk in the back door. Lorraine is skinny and they both look great.)
Lorraine: I think we need a rematch.
George: Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?
Lorraine: No.
George: Hello.
Lorraine: Good morning.
Marty: Mom, Dad. (he falls over)
Lorraine: Marty, are you alright?
George: Did you hurt your head?
(Marty gets back up.)
Marty: You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.
Lorraine: Why thank you, Marty. (George walks around her and as he does he pats her on the bottom.) George. Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning, Dave, Linda.
David: Good morning, Mom.
Linda: Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.
Lorraine: Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
Marty: What, what, ma?
Lorraine: Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.
Marty: Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.
George: Wrecked?
David: Wrecked? When did this happen?
George: Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
David: Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
(George goes over and opens the front door to reveal Biff waxing the undamaged car.)
George: See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
Biff: Just finishing up the second coat now.
George: Now Biff, don't con me.
Biff: I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.
George: That Biff, what a character. (goes back inside) Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him…
Loraine: We never would have fallen in love.
George: That's right.
(Suddenly Biff runs in carrying a box.)
Biff: Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.
Loraine: Ah, honey, your first novel.
George: Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Biff: Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Marty: Keys?
(Garage)
(Marty walks out to the garage. He finds a brand new black four by four. Just like the one he was admiring a few days ago. Jennifer walks up.)
Jennifer: How about a ride, Mister?
Marty: Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.
Jennifer: Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
Marty: I haven't.
Jennifer: You okay, is everything alright?
Marty: Aw yeah, everything is great.
(Suddenly there is a flash of light and Doc pulls into the driveway in the Delorean. He hops out and runs over to Marty.)
Doc: Marty you gotta come back with me.
Marty: Where?
Doc: Back to the future.
(Doc goes over to the garbage can and starts digging through it.)
Marty: Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?
(Doc holds up some trash.)
Doc: I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.
(He begins dumping the trash into Mr. Fusion.)
Marty: No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Doc: Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.
Marty: Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?
Doc: No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
(They all climb into the car. And Doc backs up into the street.)
Marty: Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.
Doc: Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.
(Doc pulls his sunglasses down and hits a button. Suddenly the car is airborne. They take off."

A chance to die, but can we..."

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid
[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop 
in
 my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid"

Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Café

In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

Though his body says ""stop!"", his spirit cries ""never!""

And do you ever see the letters that I write?

And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west
 and find a friend"

I hit up Puerto Rico then come back and hit the pavement
Sometimes the loudest statement, is when your saying nothing
Nobody il have your back, if your ass always fronting

And Im blowing threw the dough, like its covering my face
Got hella flavor cus a mother fu*ker got taste
Face it, mother fu*kers like you is basic
Ass and liquor chasen, its going down basement
Fu*k it let me rephrase it, I'm living in the moment
Might wrestle with the beat, but I body-slam opponents
Married to the game, no divorces or annulments
Bomb making components, but I blow-up if I don't blow it
Lyrically quoted, wonder how you ain't know it?
Maze playing Mistro. Heard I'm blowing up in the Town, my verses nitro. Plus my beats psyco, pushing whips Tyco(Toy-car maker)

Esperando pela moeda do bem-estar
Porque eles não compram um emprego
Um homem em um terno de seda se apressa
Como ele prende os olhos da pobres velhas senhoras
Só por diversão ele diz ""arrume um emprego""
Isso é só do jeito que é
Algumas coisas nunca irão mudar
Isso é só do jeito que deve ser
Mas você não acredita neles
Eles dizem, hey garotinho, você não pode ir
Onde os outros vão
Porque você não se parece como eles
Disse hey velho homem, como você pode parar
Pra pensar desse jeito
Você já pensou nisso?
Antes de você fazer as regras
Ele disse, filho
Isso é só do jeito que é
Algumas coisas nunca irão mudar
Isso é só do jeito que deve ser
Mas você não acredita neles
Bem, eles fizeram uma lei em 64
Para dar a aqueles que não conseguem ter um pouco mais
Mas isso só vai longe
Porque a lei não muda a cabeça dos outros
Quando tudo que se vê é o tempo se empregando
Da linha da cor da barra

Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star

If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there

1987,49,Hip to Be Square,Huey Lewis and the News,https://genius.com/Mary-harron-american-psycho-you-like-huey-lewis-and-the-news-annotated,"BATEMAN: 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
ALLEN: 
Um, they're okay.
BATEMAN: Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. 
But when 
Sports
 came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost
. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, 
cynical sense of humor
.
ALLEN: Hey, Halberstram?
BATEMAN: Yes, Allen?
ALLEN: Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?
BATEMAN: No, Allen.
ALLEN: 
Is that a raincoat?
BATEMAN: Yes, it is. 
In '87, Huey released this; 
Fore!
, their most accomplished album.
 
I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square""
. 
A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
 
Hey, Paul!
Bateman murders Allen with an axe

Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind

You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night

Then along came you, now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too"
1988,29,A Groovy Kind of Love,Phil Collins,https://genius.com/Phil-collins-a-groovy-kind-of-love-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
[Chorus]
Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
[Verse 2]
Anytime you want to, you can turn me onto
Anything you want to, anytime at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
[Chorus]
Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
[Interlude]
Oh-oh
[Verse 3]
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms, nothin' seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care"
1988,30,Love Bites,Def Leppard,https://genius.com/Def-leppard-love-bites-lyrics,"[Intro]
If you've got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites
[Verse 1]
When you make love, 
do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to touch you too much, baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it
No
[Chorus]
Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need"
1988,31,Endless Summer Nights,Richard Marx,https://genius.com/Richard-marx-endless-summer-nights-lyrics,"Summer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before
Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh
And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh
Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh"
1988,32,Foolish Beat,Debbie Gibson,https://genius.com/Debbie-gibson-foolish-beat-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you
[Chorus]
I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
[Verse 2]
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart"
1988,33,Where Do Broken Hearts Go,Whitney Houston,https://genius.com/Whitney-houston-where-do-broken-hearts-go-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately
[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh
[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh, baby
[Verse 2]
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind"
1988,34,Angel,Aerosmith,https://genius.com/Aerosmith-angel-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone"

Time, time, time
See what's become of me

Debbie Peterson & Michael Steele

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
[Chorus: All]
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Susanna Hoffs & Vicki Peterson

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside

Carry a cup in your hand

Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter"

Hee-hee, ooh
Go on, girl, aaow!
Hee
[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
[Chorus]
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
Uh, uh
[Verse 2]
I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me"
1988,37,"Don't Worry, Be Happy",Bobby McFerrin,https://genius.com/Bobby-mcferrin-dont-worry-be-happy-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry
Be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry
Be happy, don't worry, be happy now
[Chorus]
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
[Verse 2]
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry
Be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
But don't worry
Be happy, look at me, I'm happy"
1988,38,Make Me Lose Control,Eric Carmen,https://genius.com/Eric-carmen-make-me-lose-control-lyrics,"I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of green when the noon sun appears, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playin' ""Uptown"" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago...
My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control
We put the top down on the car, with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like the fire in July, oh yeah
Jennifer's singin' ""Stand By Me"", and she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good, or could this be just the start?
My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control
""Be My Baby"" comes on and we're movin' in time
And the heat from your touch makes me feel like I'm losin' my mind, oh yeah
(And then they play) ""Back In My Arms Again""
(We close our eyes) we start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) and now the feeling's intense
And we just pray that this night never ends"

Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

Bad medicine is what I need

There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

I ain't got a fever; got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy

Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three

First, you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude"

Say, you never know that strange one
Just might be me, yeah

If you have (if you have), everything your heart desired
Would you still want more?

But don't be fooled
It's nice work if you can get it

Ain't what she's looking for
You never know that strange heart
Just might be me"

Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

When you called me up this morning, told me 'bout the new love you found
I said, ""I'm happy for you, I'm really happy for you""
Found someone else, I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby, it's really over, baby, woah

It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

see me walking by and the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

on the streets someday and I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another

Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove

And smash any hope of democracy?

There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues, yeah, yeah

Ain't it funny how when I say let's go out
You're always saying someone else will get me?
What's a girl to do? I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous, you never let me leave

So how come you can leave
But when it comes to me
Always something I must prove? (
I must prove to you

You know I love you, always thinking of you
But tonight, I've got to make that move

I wanna have some fun (
I wanna have some fun

Move my body all night long (
Move my body all night long

I wanna have some fun (

Move my body all night long (
Move my body all night long

She wants to dance with me
Oh yeah (dance with me)
There's a girl I've been waiting to see
And I really get the feeling that she likes me
'Cos she said so, but not in so many words
I've got to tell you what I've heard
She don't want no wild romance
When she's with me she only wants to dance
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be
Now I know I've been out of touch
And I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much
'Cos I love her and I think she love me
And that's the way it's got to be
When we're together we never fight
We've got better things to do tonight
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be"

I never thought that it could be
The way it stands right now
Emotions running high
Every night I wish

Oh, but there is
Just one missing part
How to put it together
How to say it right
And let you know that
Every night

Dreamin'
Hoping, baby
You will be there"

Calling all cars

I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around
And brought about a change
In me
[Pre-Chorus]
I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were running fast
I was running slow
Everybody said that it would not work
Love came
And set me free
You were standing there to rescue me
Love caught it
We thought
Why can't we be in love?
Well"

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

To get you to notice me too?
Do I stand in line?
One of a million admiring eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

This time I know it's for real

Shout it out with a megaphone?
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you

Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine"

As he came into the window

He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

You were struck down
It was your doom"

Would be (forever)

As I sit, looking out the window
I can still remember
They call me to tell me you went away
It was such a cold day

On that Sunday morning
It came without a warning
And all the pain I felt inside
I just can't forget you
I'm feeling so alone
Though many times I've tried
Can't get you off my mind

I'm thinking of you
Wonder where you are tonight
I wish that I could hold you tight
I'm thinking of you
I wish you could stay
But you're so far away
So far away

And even though you're gone
I know you're happy where you are
And I know someday
We'll be together, together again"

1989,99,The End of the Innocence,Don Henley,https://genius.com/Don-henley-the-end-of-the-innocence-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
[Chorus]
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
[Verse 2]
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
Now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie"
