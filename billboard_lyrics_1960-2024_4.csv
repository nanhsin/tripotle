I can't prolong
Drop the beat and let's do this
I can't believe the way

You caught me by surprise
A dream come true
It was you
I didn't even know your name
Oh, no
Now you've got me thinking
Bout you every single day, girl
I can't get you off my mind
Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And I'm not the same, no, no"

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby

And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

Time to sit back and unwind
[Verse 2: The Fresh Prince]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to 
Summer Madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody go
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime"

Where the children of tomorrow dream away (

The rain is pouring down

And loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing
Says, ""don't you stay inside""
Now I can't fight this feeling
Got L.U.S.T. on my mind
[Verse 2]
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?

Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win

No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z"

I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
On your loving

I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl

Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
 (
On your loving

Come around my way"

Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck

In the hopes that there's a Heaven

And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way

For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace

And I keep on hoping for a sign

Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friends in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me somethin' to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me somethin' to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile, it fades again"

And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world

Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the 
sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy
[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be

Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man"

When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red

Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Never tried to hurt you

You know with the flow

So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like
Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)"

Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
(Chorus)
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you, I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
(Chorus)
And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay?
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love... it just ain't enough

Drunken nights in dark hotels

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""

She's just one of those corners in my mind

And never came home

Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside
(Chorus)
Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside"

In the back, sippin' Purple Chongos

Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock,

Laying in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block

Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two

1993,31,Mr. Wendal,Arrested Development,https://genius.com/Arrested-development-mr-wendal-lyrics,"Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall"

All seven and we'll watch them fall

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us, animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love, only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's all right (That's all right)
For I will watch them fall

But before I make my move my emotions start running wild
My tongue gets tied and that's no lie
I'm looking in your eyes
I'm looking in your big brown eyes
(Ooh yeah)

Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat 'til you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out I'm gonna push it some more
Girl I want to make you sweat
Sweat 'til you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out I'm gonna push it

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog (Damn)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out (What's up?)
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)"

We, like the breeze, flow straight out of our lids
Them, they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us, floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop record
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms, man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion?
Where kinky hair goes, to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut, we push it off the corner
How was the buzz, entire hip-hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like 
sixties funky worms
 with 
waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock

See, the bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'

People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac

And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright
Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants
And some Nikes, G
And yet more letters, and the letters sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?""
Yesssss.....

And we ain't got no love for the side
We only love those who love us back

A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine

Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain?
This taste of heaven, so deep, so true

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one

Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control

Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park

The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (
Yeah, yeah

I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (
Oh, yeah-yeah

And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up"

I always have been good to you
Girl I promise you that nothing has changed

Must be the reason why I did you that way
So now I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
To take a chance of ever losing
And I can't take losing you
So I'm
Never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No I'm
Never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you
I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down

You know how much I care for you

As I make the funk kickin' out more harder than a diamond (Harder than a diamond)
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!"

With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned

But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holding a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday, you'll change your mind""

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Beau
Take anybody that you want
As long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to
There won't be any harm"""

I want your love

I got a funny feeling, honey, that you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me, word is born, you be ignoring me
I know your name, yes, I do, because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet, because your girls showed me
But I'll parlay and stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant and catch you the next day
When I'm in focus, I notice you only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up with insatiable you
I never figured you for the quiet type
On the down low, the low pro-file type
I always thought you was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion, causing drama
What's the matter, huh? Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung, or maybe I ain't the one
I want to know cause if I don't, it's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me thinking you want me"

Then he get mad and wanna scrap

To play hide-and-go-get-it with the younger hoes
 by the 
bungalows
Then switch to playing 
Ding Dong Ditch

Old and too cold to hack it, 
threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearing 
Gazelles
And if they really had money, rays be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
[Chorus: T-Boz & All]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me"

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

Let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day

That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

I believe, love will find the way

Ooh-no

You might as well be honest
Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll, I'll tell you mine

Excuse me

Runaway with me, my love

Runaway with me, my love

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we're all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends"

stogie

This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away

Feeling disgust working your stuff
Until he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why 'cause he's mine
Tell you something

Never fall in love with a man

1995,42,I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By,Method Man featuring Mary J. Blige,https://genius.com/Dx-staff-love-and-hip-hop-lyrics,"Once upon a time long ago, when Stevie J was more famous for contributing to Jodeci albums than reality shows, a burgeoning relationship between Hip Hop and R&B was fostered respectively through the efforts of LL Cool J and groups like SWV. Despite Hip Hop‚Äôs sometimes well-deserved reputation for misogyny, four decades of Rap songs have chronicled both the ups and downs of being in love. In 1996, Method Man and Mary J. Blige netted a ‚ÄúBest Performance By A Duo Or Group‚Äù Grammy for ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be There For You (You‚Äôre All I Need To Get By).‚Äù On the flip side, with ‚ÄúHow Do U Want It,‚Äù the late Tupac Shakur took aim at one-time Civil Rights activist and chair of the Black Caucus of the Democratic National Committee C. Delores Tucker. Unlike Meth and Mary, ‚ÄòPac and Ms. Tucker‚Äôs encounter ended on much less happy terms; Tucker‚Äôs $10 million defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge in 1999
Nevertheless, as Valentine‚Äôs Day approaches, even the most cursory glance at your iTunes or Spotify library can bring up a ton of lovey-dovey memories. In anticipation of Valentine‚Äôs Day 2014, HipHopDX‚Äôs Editorial Staff listed a few of their favorite R&B and Rap songs. Whether you‚Äôre living the single life or enjoying the occasion with your significant other, here our some of our picks. As usual‚Äînot that you need an invitation‚Äîbut feel free to disagree or add your own picks down in the comment section
OutKast - ‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù
This one is an absolute no brainer for the Hallmark holiday soundtrack. It‚Äôs essential that it shows up on your mix, naturally. With the jam band going and the lyrics pouring out, ‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù is like the ultimate track to celebrate the coming of Cupid. Of course this one is basically Andre3000‚Äôs since it‚Äôs on The Love Below. Don‚Äôt call him Three Stacks though on this cut. Nah, he's ‚ÄúCupid Valentino,‚Äù and he‚Äôs flanked by Joi and ‚ÄúSkreechy Peachy‚Äù on the hook. Much like ‚ÄúPlayer‚Äôs Ball‚Äù is to Christmas, this track can be celebrated any time of the year
Jodeci - ‚ÄúLove U 4 Life‚Äù
When I was younger, I decided this song was going to be played at my wedding. I still feel that way, even though Jodeci is kind of scary looking nowadays. ‚ÄúLove U 4 Life‚Äù is just the ultimate eternal love kind of tune. The video though is what really drives the point home. You have T-Boz (yes of TLC) getting married to Dalvin Swing. That was perfect because Dalvin was dating T-Boz at the time. Awwww! It was such a sweet ode to love and it was handled in the least mushy way possible. Heads up though: T-Boz and Dalvin are long since broken up
112 - ‚ÄúCupid‚Äù
If you don't cry when you hear this song, then you have no heart. Seriously. Room 112 might be where the players dwell, but the Bad Boy group put it all out there. ‚ÄúCupid doesn‚Äôt lie, but you won't know unless we give it a try,‚Äù they sing on the hook. It‚Äôs beautiful and heartfelt, and everything you need out of a love song.

Raekwon feat. Cappachino, Method Man & Ghostface Killah - ‚ÄúIce Cream‚Äù
Method Man and Mary J. Blige‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll I Need‚Äù is the default Hip Hop love jam for most non-Wu heads, but a subsequent Meth appearance alongside Rae, Ghostface and Cappadonna (who was still going by Cappachino at the time) is usually the one that appeals to the hard rocks. If Twitter were invented when this dropped back in 1995, #SwapMeetLove might have become a trending hashtag during the premiere of this video. That said, these three Wu Gambinos held it down for an entire pre-Drake generation of males who had trouble articulating their emotions to the ladies in their lives. Having trouble getting down ‚Äúon bended knee‚Äù to propose to your boo? Just ask her to ‚Äúgo ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu.‚Äù Besides, any time you can get a Valentine‚Äôs Day anthem that personifies women of different ethnicities as ice cream flavors while Ghost references the Supreme Alphabet (‚Äúshe turns me on like Vine C Allah Rule‚Äù), you gladly take it
Fashawn - ‚ÄúLupita‚Äù
Unrequited love can be rough in Hip Hop. One end of the spectrum features a bottomless well of self pity best evidenced by Pharcyde‚Äôs ‚ÄúPassin‚Äô Me By.‚Äù And the other end of the spectrum channels rejection into anger much like when Ice Cube rhymed, ‚ÄúWe didn't get no play, from the ladies / With six niggas in a car are you crazy / She was scared, and it was showin‚Äô / We all said fuck you bitch and kept goin‚Äô.‚Äù On his 2009 album, Boy Meets World, Fashawn struck the perfect balance. Fash retraces his steps from innocent infatuation (complete with poem writing), to the friend zone and ending with a polite letdown from the object of his affection. ‚ÄúMaybe in another life,‚Äù Lupita offered. Damn. Ultimately Fashawn took his L with dignity, and provided a playful, fun and realistic look at what sometimes happens when Cupid‚Äôs arrow misfires
UGK - ‚ÄúFeelin‚Äô You‚Äù
Prior to his untimely death in 2007, ‚ÄúSweet Jones‚Äù was cornering the market on grown man Rap. This wasn‚Äôt merely throwing on a button down oxford and breaking out some soft raps over Neptunes production. Pimp C was laying down his full-on linen suit, Tom Joyner boat cruise, middle aged mack. He shouts out the women who value ‚Äúputtin‚Äô it down for your kids‚Äù and temporarily retires some of his more abrasive bars in favor of a falsetto and some backing harmony on the hook. Producer Steve Below flipped Maze featuring Frankie Beverly‚Äôs ‚ÄúFeel That You‚Äôre Feelin‚Äô,‚Äù but just because this is mature fare doesn‚Äôt mean Bun and Pimp are getting geriatric with it. All ladies with ‚Äúthe backside swole up‚Äù and a mix of ‚Äúclass and panache with precision‚Äù get invited to this affair that features the Port Arthur, Texas natives trading in trunk popping for two-stepping"

Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you

It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please, baby, can't you see
I'm tryin' to explain

You went away, now my life is just a rainy day

Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That it once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be

You are appreciated
[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated"

Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right

More than a stealth bomber

The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet

With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me
But, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go
And even in my dreams
I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' 
phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
,
So how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause
 when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their man ball
Dag, y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, sca-bobble""
Got hit with a bottle
And put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box
And nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach

Of me and her together, right?

Of sights to see

The vendors and the dealers

Have I been lost?
Inside myself and my own mind?

In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet

You say you found someone to hold you

Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you

Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you

1995,92,"""Dream About You"" / ""Funky Melody""",Stevie B,https://genius.com/Time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift-annotated,"Taylor Swift is telling me a story, and when Taylor Swift tells you a story, you listen, because you know it‚Äôs going to be good‚Äînot only because she‚Äôs had an extraordinary life, but because she‚Äôs an extraordinary storyteller. This one is about a time she got her heart broken, although not in the way you might expect.
She was 17, she says, and she had booked the biggest opportunity of her life so far‚Äîa highly coveted slot opening for country superstar Kenny Chesn–µy on tour. ‚ÄúThis was going to change my career,‚Äù she rem–µmbers. ‚ÄúI was so excited.‚Äù But a couple weeks later, Swift arrived home to find her mother Andrea sitting on the front steps of their house. ‚ÄúShe was weeping,‚Äù Swift says. ‚ÄúHer head was in her hands as if there had been a family emergency.‚Äù Through sobs, Andrea told her daughter that Chesney‚Äôs tour had been sponsored by a beer company. Taylor was too young to join. ‚ÄúI was devastated,‚Äù Swift says.
But some months later, at Swift‚Äôs 18th birthday party, she saw Chesney‚Äôs promoter. He handed her a card from Chesney that read, as Swift recalls, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that you couldn‚Äôt come on the tour, so I wanted to make it up to you.‚Äù With the note was a check. ‚ÄúIt was for more money than I‚Äôd ever seen in my life,‚Äù Swift says. ‚ÄúI was able to pay my band bonuses. I was able to pay for my tour buses. I was able to fuel my dreams.‚Äù
Listening to Swift share this, on a clear fall afternoon in her New York City apartment, I‚Äôm struck by how satisfying the story is. There are high stakes at the outset; there are details, vivid and sensory; there‚Äôs a twist that flips the action on its head; and there‚Äôs a happy ending for its hero. It takes her only about 30 seconds to recount this, but those 30 seconds contain an entire narrative world.
I‚Äôm not surprised. Swift has a preternatural skill for finding the story. Her anecdote about Chesney symbolizes a larger narrative in Swift‚Äôs life, one about redemption‚Äîwhere our protagonist discovers new happiness not despite challenges, but because of them. Swift, as we‚Äôll discuss, took a few hits to get here. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been raised up and down the flagpole of public opinion so many times in the last 20 years,‚Äù she says as we tuck into a cozy den off the kitchen to talk, and she kicks off her shoes and curls up onto the sofa. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been given a tiara, then had it taken away.‚Äù She is seemingly unguarded in conversation, reflective about both where she‚Äôs been and where she finds herself now. After all, while she‚Äôs long been one of the biggest entertainers in the world, this year is different. ‚ÄúIt feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.‚Äù This is her story‚Äîeven if she‚Äôs now so high that it‚Äôs hard to believe she was ever low.
Swift‚Äôs accomplishments as an artist‚Äîculturally, critically, and commercially‚Äîare so legion that to recount them seems almost beside the point. As a pop star, she sits in rarefied company, alongside Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna; as a songwriter, she has been compared to Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Joni Mitchell. As a businesswoman, she has built an empire worth, by some estimates, over $1 billion. And as a celebrity‚Äî
who by dint of being a woman is scrutinized for everything from whom she dates
 to what she wears‚Äîshe has long commanded constant attention and knows how to use it. (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give Taylor advice about being famous,‚Äù Stevie Nicks tells me. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù) But this year, something shifted. To discuss her movements felt like discussing politics or the weather‚Äîa language spoken so widely it needed no context. She became the main character of the world.
If you‚Äôre skeptical, consider it: How many conversations did you have about Taylor Swift this year? How many times did you see a photo of her while scrolling on your phone? Were you one of the people who made a pilgrimage to a city where she played? Did you buy a ticket to her concert film? Did you double-tap an Instagram post, or laugh at a tweet, or click on a headline about her? Did you find yourself humming ‚ÄúCruel Summer‚Äù while waiting in line at the grocery store? Did a friend confess that they watched clips of the 
Eras Tour
 night after night on TikTok? Or did you?
Her epic career-retrospective tour recounting her artistic ‚Äúeras,‚Äù which played 66 dates across the Americas this year, is projected to become the biggest of all time and the first to gross over a billion dollars; analysts talked about the ‚ÄúTaylor effect,‚Äù as politicians from Thailand, Hungary, and Chile implored her to play their countries. Cities, stadiums, and streets were renamed for her. Every time she came to a new place, a mini economic boom took place as hotels and restaurants saw a surge of visitors. In releasing her concert movie, Swift bypassed studios and streamers, instead forging an unusual pact with AMC, giving the theater chain its highest single-day ticket sales in history. There are at least 10 college classes devoted to her, including one at Harvard; the professor, Stephanie Burt, tells TIME she plans to compare Swift‚Äôs work to that of the poet William Words-worth. Friendship bracelets traded by her fans at concerts became a hot accessory, with one line in a song causing as much as a 500% increase in sales at craft stores. When Swift started dating Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chief and two-time Super Bowl champion, his games saw a massive increase in viewership. (Yes, she somehow made one of America‚Äôs most popular things‚Äîfootball‚Äîeven more popular.) And then there‚Äôs her critically hailed songbook‚Äîa catalog so beloved that as she rereleases it, she‚Äôs often breaking chart records she herself set. She‚Äôs the last monoculture left in our stratified world.
It‚Äôs hard to see history when you‚Äôre in the middle of it, harder still to distinguish Swift‚Äôs impact on the culture from her celebrity, which emits so much light it can be blinding. But something unusual is happening with Swift, without a contemporary precedent. She deploys the most efficient medium of the day‚Äîthe pop song‚Äîto tell her story. Yet over time, she has harnessed the power of the media, both traditional and new, to create something wholly unique‚Äîa narrative world, in which her music is just one piece in an interactive, shape-shifting story. Swift is that story‚Äôs architect and hero, protagonist and narrator.
This was the year she perfected her craft‚Äînot just with her music, but in her position as the master storyteller of the modern era. The world, in turn, watched, clicked, cried, danced, sang along, swooned, caravanned to stadiums and movie theaters, let her work soundtrack their lives. For Swift, it‚Äôs a peak. ‚ÄúThis is the proudest and happiest I‚Äôve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I‚Äôve ever been,‚Äù Swift tells me. ‚ÄúUltimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there‚Äôs only one question.‚Äù Here, she adopts a booming voice. ‚ÄúAre you not entertained?‚Äù
A few months before I sit with Swift in New York, on a summer night in Santa Clara, Calif., which has been temporarily renamed Swiftie Clara in her honor, I am in a stadium with nearly 70,000 other people having a religious experience. The crowd is rapturous and Swift beatific as she gazes out at us, all high on the same drug. Her fans are singularly passionate, not just in the venue but also online, as they analyze clues, hints, and secret messages in everything from her choreography to her costumes‚Äîsome deliberately planted, others not. (‚ÄúTaylor Swift fans are the modern-day equivalent of those cults who would consistently have inaccurate rapture predictions like once a month,‚Äù as one viral tweet noted.)
Standing in the arena, it‚Äôs not hard to understand why this is the biggest thing in the world. ‚ÄúBeatlemania and Thriller have nothing on these shows,‚Äù says Swift‚Äôs friend and collaborator Phoebe Bridgers. Fans in Argentina pitched tents outside the venue for months to get prime spots, with some quitting their jobs to commit to fandom full time. Across the U.S., others lined up for days, while those who didn‚Äôt get in ‚ÄúTaylor-gated‚Äù in nearby parking lots so they could pick up the sound. When tickets went on sale last year, Ticketmaster crashed. Although 4.1 million tickets were sold for the 2023 shows‚Äîincluding over 2 million on the first day, a new record‚Äîscalpers jacked up prices on the secondary market to more than $22,000. Multiple fans filed lawsuits. The Justice Department moved forward with an investigation. The Senate held a hearing. Given these stakes, Swift had to deliver.
‚ÄúI knew this tour was harder than anything I‚Äôd ever done before by a long shot,‚Äù Swift says. Each show spans over 180 minutes, including 40-plus songs from at least nine albums; there are 16 costume changes, pyrotechnics, an optical illusion in which she appears to dive into the stage and swim, and not one but two cottagecore worlds, which feature an abundance of moss."

What would you ask if you had just one question?

Doctors have come from distant cities
Just to see me
Stand over my bed
Disbelieving what they're seeing
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of God's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation
Newspapers ask intimate questions
Want confessions
They reach into my head
To steal the glory of my story
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of god's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation

Oh, I believe
Fate smiled and destiny
Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience and with faith
She'll make her way
She'll make her way"

1996,33,Gangsta's Paradise,Coolio featuring L.V.,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Dying for the color of a rag

Well, who hasn't been there before?
I come 'round
Around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, 
scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again"

It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now
[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
[Verse 2]
I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing"

B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for your ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whose body? Your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight to you loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right
[Chorus: Xscape]
Keep on, keep keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love's so brand new
Keep on keep keepin' on
Doin' it right, right, right"

1996,91,Po Pimp,Do or Die featuring Twista,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'll stay in a bed
Oh, blue eyes, I seen him
If just once, I could feel loved
Oh, stare back at me, yeah"

Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't want to lose you
So baby...
[Chorus]
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
[Verse 1]
Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head
All of the time, oh baby
But all I do, is think about the way you make me feel
'Cause baby, this love is so real
[Chorus]
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
[Verse 2]
If I try to spend some time with you to make you happy
Would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love"

You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes, you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry
[Chorus]
Well, there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you
[Verse 2]
You look at me, you got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you, but you wanna wear my ring
[Chorus]
Well, there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
[Verse 3]
Put on a little Dylan, sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherit a million bucks and when she died, it came to me
[Chorus]
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you
[Verse 4]
Sometimes, I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes, you're crazy, then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Dolphins make me cry
[Chorus]
But there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you"
1996,100,Don't Cry,Seal,https://genius.com/Seal-dont-cry-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Don't be so hard on yourself
Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh, my baby
Please, my baby
My baby
[Verse 2]
When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then
And we lived our life without any doubt
Those memories
They seem so long ago
What's become of them?
When you feel like me, I want you to know
[Hook]
Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby"
1997,1,Candle in the Wind 1997,Elton John,https://genius.com/Elton-john-candle-in-the-wind-1997-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years"
1997,2,You Were Meant for Me,Jewel,https://genius.com/Jewel-you-were-meant-for-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I hear the clock, it's 6 a.m.¬†
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
[Chorus]
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
[Verse 2]
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause"

1997,4,Un-Break My Heart,Toni Braxton,https://genius.com/Toni-braxton-un-break-my-heart-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
[Chorus]
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
[Verse 2]
Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me"
1997,5,Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,Puff Daddy featuring Mase,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

[Verse 1]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
[Pre-Chorus]
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it
[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo)

See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh"

You have the right to lose control (Yeah, don't let go)

I often tell myself that we could be
More than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around ('Round, 'round)
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows
[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

What's it gonna be? 'Cause I can't pretend (I can't pretend, no)

Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me

You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

You're my world, my heart, my soul

And if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion
, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye
[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?
[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care

[Intro: Diana Ross]
I'm coming out
I'm coming
I'm coming out
I'm coming
[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie"
1997,21,The Freshmen,The Verve Pipe,https://genius.com/The-verve-pipe-the-freshmen-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
When I was young, I knew everything
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin', with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't be held responsible
'Cause was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
[Chorus]
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, 
we were merely freshmen
[Verse 2]
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin', with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said
[Pre-Chorus]
""Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place"""

Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain; I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball
That I need to, I want to

Daniel Jones

Well, come stand a little bit closer (
Oh-oh
)
Breathe in and get a bit higher (
Oh-oh

Oh-oh
)

get to you
[Chorus]
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I would die to find out
[Verse 2: Darren Hayes]
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look, then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat"

Ich mag die Playettes
Ohne Zweifel, ohne Zweifel, ah
Mach weiter, Playette
Mach weiter, Playette
Yo, Dre, hau raus
[Strophe 1: Dr. Dre]
Es geht ab, blende zu Blackstreet
Die Homies haben es auf mich abgesehen, Kollaborationskreationen sind wie Akne
Kein Zweifel, ich hab's drauf, ich bin nie nachl√§ssig
Solange mein Kredit b√ºrgt, k√∂nnte mich kein Hund schnappen
Sag mir, wer aufh√∂ren kann, wenn Dre Moves macht
Die M√§dels wie ein Magnet anzieht
Ihnen Ohrgasmen gebe mit meinem sanften Akzent
Ich bewege immer noch diesen Flair
Mit den Kumpels Blackstreet und Teddy
Die echten Rump Shaker
[Strophe 2: Teddy Riley]
Shawty, geht in die Knie, guter Gott
Baby hat die ganze Stadt f√ºr sich offen
Strikt im Gesch√§ft, sie spielt nicht herum
Sie deckt viele Gebiete ab, Kundschaft in Massen
Bezahlt zu werden ist ihre St√§rke
Jeden einzelnen Tag, wie ein echter Player
Ich kriege sie nicht aus dem Kopf (Wow)
Ich denke die ganze Zeit an das M√§dchen (Wow-wow)
Von der Eastside zur Westside
Pusht fette Fahrten, es ist keine √úberraschung
Sie hat Tricks im Versteck, stapelt das Geld
Schnell, wenn es um das Benzin geht
Auf keinen Fall durchschnittlich
Sie ist dabei, wenn sie es haben muss
Baby, du bist eine perfekte Zehn, ich will mitmachen
Kann ich einsteigen, damit ich gewinnen kann?"

You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love
Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?
Show me the way, don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment, I'm just thinking of you
[Chorus]
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
(Ooh-ah) A little bit more
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
(Ooh-ah) A little bit more
(Ooh-ah) Just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore
[Verse 2]
Feeling good, let's go all the way
It's got to be, set me free
But tonight, let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go
How can I prove my love to you?
Baby, please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true"

I feel like I've been blown apart, there are pieces here
I don't know where they go, I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips,
 I bet you feel a little crazy
But for me, we'll be famous on TV
[Chorus]
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
[Verse 2]
I jump on you, you jump on me, you push me out
And even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth
When I kiss your salty lips, you will feel a little crazy
But for me, I'll be famous on TV
[Chorus]
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
[Chorus]
Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it"

Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

Hoh hoh hoh

You can hardly wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine
And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Every time he walks by
And if you're feeling down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when you're makin' love
He's everything you've been dreaming of
Oh baby
[Chorus]
I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (oh hoh hoh)
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man (yeah)
(Ohoh, you don't see me baby)
[Verse 2]
You probably spend hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all (talkin' 'bout nothing at all)
It doesn't matter what the conversation
Just as long as he calls (ohhhhh)
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
And you wipe away each other's tears (all of those tears)
Your face lights up whenever he appears
Ohhhhhh"

Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel

And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

1997,58,Up Jumps da Boogie,Magoo and Timbaland,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow

Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?
Oh, you're so beautiful
With an edge and a charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in

And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin'
And smokin'
Pretending not to loc'in but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika round the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his 20
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause you just lost a hustler
A down ass brother been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for you, I know I can't trust you
Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like a brother no more
I guess that's just the way it go

1997,80,No Time,Lil' Kim featuring Puff Daddy,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

Wearing nothing is divine
Naked is a state of mind
I take things off to clear my head
To say the things I haven't said
Live inside the elements
The earth and sky are my best friends
Water is the evidence
That washes me from end to end
[Chorus]
With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see
[Verse 2]
It's not a choice I tried to make
It's not a thought I couldn't take
Something told me it was time
To give you yours and leave me mine
My vision started to be clear
I watched the sunlight coming near
I knew the day I knew the night
I knew I could regain my sight"

That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's 
dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens
 with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world, they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time

Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait

And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat

Well, I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven then make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of...

How do I get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?
Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now
[Chorus]
How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?
[Verse 2]
Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now"

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
Hey, it's about you, baby
Look deeper inside you, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause

I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you

And I will never find another lover
More precious than you

Girl you are

Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother
You are the only one, my everything
And for you this song I sing

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years"

You know I'm coming over, right?

Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Be there in about...
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
(Now, baby, tell what you wanna do with me?)
[Verse 1]
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets, ah yeah
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean
[Chorus]
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?)
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow

She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be... sorry?"

I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I wanna get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss
[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me"

Get your ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money, fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay, so I look both ways
Cop say it's okay, my tint smoke gray
No way nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Lamb' and my 6

Gonna make a break and take a fake

Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know the vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

1998,59,Lookin' at Me,Mase featuring Puff Daddy,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me

With starlight tonight

Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see through your eyes

She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here

Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting

Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn

Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum (Minimum)
Ni*** ****

Now, Lauryn is only human (Human)
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament (I been there)
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn (Philly, Penn)
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in ('Cause it's in)

Fake nails done by Koreans"

Open up shop, I had to pay on these bills
Might had to sell a lil-
I don't feel hungry enough
Might have to skip on some meals
My circle small like a cell, I'm hard to kill I'm like Cell (Dragon ball)
Don't talk about it on cell, I do what I like, it don't sell
Sometimes when you mumble it sound like 
Bawitdaba wa dang da dang, Kid Rock
Put the lit end in my mouth, that's why I spit hot
Basically untouchable, got a fast hitbox
Have to pay to live on Earth, that's why I'm pissed off
It's not weird, it's just hot guys in Speedos
I like Slim Jims and I like hot Cheetos
And the packs always loud, cause the plug wears tie dye
I was smoking in the bathroom and they kicked me out the Five Guys
How you on th–µ net hating but you in the crib with your feet dirty?
Don't play tough, get ch–µwed through like beef jerky
You said you didn't suck dick so why are your knees dirty?

I go super sonic like a new Sega
Running through your house like a Tomb Raider

Pissing on 'em like newspapers
Seen 'em on the 10 o'clock news, no news anchors
Unpack the truck but I don't have no neighbors
Rolled up a gram, had to use like two papers
Sole out, my feet dragging
Showing my ass it's 'cause my jeans sagging
Talk a quick game, so why you keep lagging?
Pack loud, I siphoned gas out of a G-Wagon (You goin' to jail)
Mac and cheese with the Popeyes (Chicken)
Church was involved, mob ties (Clipping)
Kick 'em in the face, Muay Thai"

We can make love or not at all

Birdman: Time changes time. Everything about the game changed from 10 years ago to now. You never had none of the things that we have now, like the Internet. So many different ways for us to make money now in music. And it‚Äôs so digital. We‚Äôre a digital-driven brand, we‚Äôre an Internet brand.
We global nowadays. 15 years ago, when we first jumped on the scene with Universal, we had gotten too big as artists to be independent. But I still look at us as an indie company because we‚Äôre self-contained, we‚Äôre self owned. We came in the game self-contained, we probably the last independent label that lasted as long as it did. We our own bosses, run our own ship.
For years we did it all off our own money. [The Universal deal] was a risk from day one, but I refuse to let somebody take something that we work hard for and just take half of it. I couldn‚Äôt see myself doing that.
What do you see happening in the future of the music business?
It‚Äôs gonna keep getting bigger. Music is spreading into all TVs, networks, and sports. It‚Äôs gonna keep expanding. There gonna be quicker ways to become a millionaire. People gonna be playing with millions off of music.
It‚Äôs more prosperous, we have so much technology. You don‚Äôt have to be an artist if you got some different type of technology‚Äîyou can make money in a lot of different ways.
I‚Äôll also say we‚Äôll be the first billion-dollar brand of music, that‚Äôs our goal. We never had a billionaire brand in music, the closest thing we had was Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson sold 750 million records. I think we‚Äôre gonna set the tone for other youngsters to make more money and see that a billion dollars can be accomplished.
How many records has Cash Money sold so far?
We sold 150 million so far. Our track record runs deep. We‚Äôve been the most dominant force of 2011, we gonna be the most dominant force of 2012. We have 16 releases in the first six months of this year. Our goal, as a brand, is to put out 100 albums a year. So I‚Äôm trying to figure out how we gonna reach that‚Ä¶
100 albums a year?
We gonna do 16 in the first six months and we gonna try this year to try to put out at least 30 this year. Next year, we‚Äôll try to put out 50. We just gonna keep growing. To have 100 active acts is a lot. It ain‚Äôt just rappers, it‚Äôs different artists in different parts of the country: rap, pop, country, gospel‚Äîits everything.

I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!"

Kaboom, kaboom, the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims smoked sims whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw from whoo'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill but I cut for the cause
Smokin' budda with a hoota' get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters leed a luga with duga
Some say modeling and acting mean Treach is selling (man, he's sellin')
While I'm yelling first a felon with my gat at ya melon

BOOYAH

Hella heated, I'm too ill for them to beat it
We the most cheated most weeded most needed
You best believe it
Let's take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
You're damned to be without the jamboree"

If you could realize all the dreams you have inside

Just open up your heart and let it show you the way

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in leavin'
Somebody's gonna give you back what you've been givin'
And I hope that I'm around
To watch 'em knock you down

Just like you loved me and left me
It's like you to do that sort of thing
Over and over again
You're a fool-hearted man

I hear you've been askin' about me from some of my friends
Well you'd better believe I'm not goin' through that again

And I'm thinkin' that maybe someday

Somebody's gonna give you a lesson in losin'
Somebody's gonna do to you what you've been doin'
And I hope that I'm around

And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

And I can promise anything that I do

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier"

In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose
I'm faded, flat busted
Been jaded, I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose
[Chorus]
Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out"

I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time
'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me
[Chorus]
Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know"
