Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on! I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing
[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need

On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (

The rain is pouring down

And loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing
Says, ""don't you stay inside""
Now I can't fight this feeling
Got L.U.S.T. on my mind
[Verse 2]
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win

Her lips are calling to me
No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z"

Sly as can be tight dress and all

I tried to chill, she made the move
Now, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no
Yeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
On your loving
[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl

Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
 (
On your loving

Come around my way"

What are we gonna do (Hey) with it? (Now)

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my coin inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can touch cheeks snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A snugglin', bubblin' overweight lovin' hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV?
Let me take time to set your mind and your body free

Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck
Shake me, shake me, baby-baby, bake me
No need to fake, here I am come on and take me
Wind your body, baby, move your body
I see you slip sliding, come on and do it, hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky–dory about this thing that I found

What are we gonna do with it?

Every night I say a prayer
In the hopes that there's a Heaven

Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way

For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred

To find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know"

The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears

Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friends in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me somethin' to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me somethin' to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news

As the tears rolled down my face

Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile, it fades again"

A doorway that I run through in the night

And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world

Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the 
sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle

Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah
[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy
[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man"

I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red
 and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
[Verse 2]
Every day I wake up, I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which so many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything all right"

No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back

Miles away

Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like
Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up"

Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say
[Verse 2]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)"

Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
(Chorus)
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you, I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
(Chorus)
And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay?
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love... it just ain't enough

Drunken nights in dark hotels

Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside"

In the back, sippin' Purple Chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us
Forty grippin', panty sippin', and it sneaks up right behind us
Quick left, one blow K.O
Hit the road to the next episode

A fifth of Heem, for me to get bent on
Hit the Country Club to pick up M-L

Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock,
 
jimmy in the glove
Laying in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block

Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two

1993,31,Mr. Wendal,Arrested Development,https://genius.com/Arrested-development-mr-wendal-lyrics,"Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall"

That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man

And I scream from the top of my lungs

All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
 and we will smoke them all

No one in the whole universe will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all space and time
So don't cry
One day all seven will die

All seven and we'll watch them fall

So don't cry
One day all seven will die

And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand, she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us, animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love, only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's all right (That's all right)
For I will watch them fall

And the truth is baby you're all that I need

Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)"

Us, floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop record
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms, man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion?
Where kinky hair goes, to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut, we push it off the corner
How was the buzz, entire hip-hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like 
sixties funky worms
 with 
waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock

See, the bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'

People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac

And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright
Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants
And some Nikes, G
And yet more letters, and the letters sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?""
Yesssss.....

And we ain't got no love for the side
We only love those who love us back

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club, either

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store, too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie

Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
[Verse 1: 2Pac & 
Dave Hollister

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
 (
Oh
)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
 (
Oh
)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (
You don't need him
)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (
Yeah, yeah
)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (
Oh, yeah-yeah
)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up"

I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way

And I can't take losing you

But I didn't want to let you down

)
[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!"
1994,83,Prayer for the Dying,Seal,https://genius.com/Seal-prayer-for-the-dying-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Fearless people
Careless needle
Harsh words spoken
And lives are broken
Forceful agin'
Help me, I'm fadin'
Heaven's waitin'
It's time to move on
[Chorus]
Crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on
[Verse 2]
Just say, ""Die,"" and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dyin'
I just don't know what's got into me"

Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
[Verse 2]
You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else"

I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say

But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry (Everyday)
Yes, everyday I fall (Everyday)
Do you ever wonder why (Everyday)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you, but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by (Everyday)
And everyday I fall (Everyday)
It makes me wonder why (Everyday)
My life's worth nothing without you"

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holding a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday, you'll change your mind""
[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said
[Chorus]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Beau
Take anybody that you want
As long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl
[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips
In front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to
There won't be any harm"""

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love
[Verse 1]
I got a funny feeling, honey, that you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me, word is born, you be ignoring me
I know your name, yes, I do, because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet, because your girls showed me
But I'll parlay and stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant and catch you the next day
When I'm in focus, I notice you only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up with insatiable you
I never figured you for the quiet type
On the down low, the low pro-file type
I always thought you was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion, causing drama
What's the matter, huh? Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung, or maybe I ain't the one
I want to know cause if I don't, it's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me thinking you want me"

When she walked in the room

Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye

When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it, so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along, nagging
If she had a sis, maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985?
All the way live, I think I was about 10
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin' 
""Yo momma black,"" his momma ""this,"" his momma ""that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about–10 minutes, then it's like–back on the bike
To play hide-and-go-get-it with the younger hoes
 by the 
bungalows
Then switch to playing 
Ding Dong Ditch
, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, 
threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearing 
Gazelles
And if they really had money, rays be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they 
Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce, then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days"

But if there's something I feel strongly about, then I'll discuss it
And if I only make one album before I kick the bucket?
I'll hold that album to my heart in my grave and say ""FUCK
 IT""...

1995,1,Gangsta's Paradise,Coolio featuring L.V.,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
[Chorus: T-Boz & All]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me"

Said nobody is supposed to know

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

Let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone

Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you

The heron and the otter are my friends

stogie

This I pray

1995,42,I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By,Method Man featuring Mary J. Blige,https://genius.com/Dx-staff-love-and-hip-hop-lyrics,"Once upon a time long ago, when Stevie J was more famous for contributing to Jodeci albums than reality shows, a burgeoning relationship between Hip Hop and R&B was fostered respectively through the efforts of LL Cool J and groups like SWV. Despite Hip Hop’s sometimes well-deserved reputation for misogyny, four decades of Rap songs have chronicled both the ups and downs of being in love. In 1996, Method Man and Mary J. Blige netted a “Best Performance By A Duo Or Group” Grammy for “I’ll Be There For You (You’re All I Need To Get By).” On the flip side, with “How Do U Want It,” the late Tupac Shakur took aim at one-time Civil Rights activist and chair of the Black Caucus of the Democratic National Committee C. Delores Tucker. Unlike Meth and Mary, ‘Pac and Ms. Tucker’s encounter ended on much less happy terms; Tucker’s $10 million defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge in 1999
Nevertheless, as Valentine’s Day approaches, even the most cursory glance at your iTunes or Spotify library can bring up a ton of lovey-dovey memories. In anticipation of Valentine’s Day 2014, HipHopDX’s Editorial Staff listed a few of their favorite R&B and Rap songs. Whether you’re living the single life or enjoying the occasion with your significant other, here our some of our picks. As usual—not that you need an invitation—but feel free to disagree or add your own picks down in the comment section
OutKast - “Happy Valentine’s Day”
This one is an absolute no brainer for the Hallmark holiday soundtrack. It’s essential that it shows up on your mix, naturally. With the jam band going and the lyrics pouring out, “Happy Valentine’s Day” is like the ultimate track to celebrate the coming of Cupid. Of course this one is basically Andre3000’s since it’s on The Love Below. Don’t call him Three Stacks though on this cut. Nah, he's “Cupid Valentino,” and he’s flanked by Joi and “Skreechy Peachy” on the hook. Much like “Player’s Ball” is to Christmas, this track can be celebrated any time of the year
Jodeci - “Love U 4 Life”
When I was younger, I decided this song was going to be played at my wedding. I still feel that way, even though Jodeci is kind of scary looking nowadays. “Love U 4 Life” is just the ultimate eternal love kind of tune. The video though is what really drives the point home. You have T-Boz (yes of TLC) getting married to Dalvin Swing. That was perfect because Dalvin was dating T-Boz at the time. Awwww! It was such a sweet ode to love and it was handled in the least mushy way possible. Heads up though: T-Boz and Dalvin are long since broken up
112 - “Cupid”
If you don't cry when you hear this song, then you have no heart. Seriously. Room 112 might be where the players dwell, but the Bad Boy group put it all out there. “Cupid doesn’t lie, but you won't know unless we give it a try,” they sing on the hook. It’s beautiful and heartfelt, and everything you need out of a love song. Next time you’re bumpin’ “Peaches & Cream” and remembering the good ol’ days, don’t forget to throw this one on too and have a Drake-sized cry. It’ll be worth it. Trust
Raekwon feat. Cappachino, Method Man & Ghostface Killah - “Ice Cream”
Method Man and Mary J. Blige’s “All I Need” is the default Hip Hop love jam for most non-Wu heads, but a subsequent Meth appearance alongside Rae, Ghostface and Cappadonna (who was still going by Cappachino at the time) is usually the one that appeals to the hard rocks. If Twitter were invented when this dropped back in 1995, #SwapMeetLove might have become a trending hashtag during the premiere of this video. That said, these three Wu Gambinos held it down for an entire pre-Drake generation of males who had trouble articulating their emotions to the ladies in their lives. Having trouble getting down “on bended knee” to propose to your boo? Just ask her to “go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu.” Besides, any time you can get a Valentine’s Day anthem that personifies women of different ethnicities as ice cream flavors while Ghost references the Supreme Alphabet (“she turns me on like Vine C Allah Rule”), you gladly take it
Fashawn - “Lupita”
Unrequited love can be rough in Hip Hop. One end of the spectrum features a bottomless well of self pity best evidenced by Pharcyde’s “Passin’ Me By.” And the other end of the spectrum channels rejection into anger much like when Ice Cube rhymed, “We didn't get no play, from the ladies / With six niggas in a car are you crazy / She was scared, and it was showin’ / We all said fuck you bitch and kept goin’.” On his 2009 album, Boy Meets World, Fashawn struck the perfect balance. Fash retraces his steps from innocent infatuation (complete with poem writing), to the friend zone and ending with a polite letdown from the object of his affection. “Maybe in another life,” Lupita offered. Damn. Ultimately Fashawn took his L with dignity, and provided a playful, fun and realistic look at what sometimes happens when Cupid’s arrow misfires
UGK - “Feelin’ You”
Prior to his untimely death in 2007, “Sweet Jones” was cornering the market on grown man Rap. This wasn’t merely throwing on a button down oxford and breaking out some soft raps over Neptunes production. Pimp C was laying down his full-on linen suit, Tom Joyner boat cruise, middle aged mack. He shouts out the women who value “puttin’ it down for your kids” and temporarily retires some of his more abrasive bars in favor of a falsetto and some backing harmony on the hook. Producer Steve Below flipped Maze featuring Frankie Beverly’s “Feel That You’re Feelin’,” but just because this is mature fare doesn’t mean Bun and Pimp are getting geriatric with it. All ladies with “the backside swole up” and a mix of “class and panache with precision” get invited to this affair that features the Port Arthur, Texas natives trading in trunk popping for two-stepping"

Please, baby, can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for somethin' new
And some other woman is lookin' like somethin'
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her 'til the screamin' is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you nothing's wrong

But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across a fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Please, baby, can't you see
I'm tryin' to explain
I've been here before and I'm lockin' the door
And I'm not goin' back again

Won't make it go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today"

You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That it once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

I'll dedicate all my love until you want me, baby

You are appreciated
[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated"

Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right

Keepin' it real enables me to make another mill

Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga

now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber
, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six-four Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me
But, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go
And even in my dreams
I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' 
phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
,
So how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause
 when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their man ball
Dag, y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, sca-bobble""
Got hit with a bottle
And put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box
And nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses

Of me and her together, right?

Inside myself and my own mind?

Fin to creep to the pad cause moms got the grub on the grill

Is it so hard to satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?
[Chorus]
Baby, tell me, does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?
Tell me, does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do?
Like the way I do?

Can I survive all the implications?
Even if I tried, could you be less than an addiction?
Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg, steal and lie
And fight, kill and die

Hold you like I do?"

1995,92,"""Dream About You"" / ""Funky Melody""",Stevie B,https://genius.com/Time-magazine-person-of-the-year-2023-taylor-swift-annotated,"Taylor Swift is telling me a story, and when Taylor Swift tells you a story, you listen, because you know it’s going to be good—not only because she’s had an extraordinary life, but because she’s an extraordinary storyteller. This one is about a time she got her heart broken, although not in the way you might expect.
She was 17, she says, and she had booked the biggest opportunity of her life so far—a highly coveted slot opening for country superstar Kenny Chesnеy on tour. “This was going to change my career,” she remеmbers. “I was so excited.” But a couple weeks later, Swift arrived home to find her mother Andrea sitting on the front steps of their house. “She was weeping,” Swift says. “Her head was in her hands as if there had been a family emergency.” Through sobs, Andrea told her daughter that Chesney’s tour had been sponsored by a beer company. Taylor was too young to join. “I was devastated,” Swift says.
But some months later, at Swift’s 18th birthday party, she saw Chesney’s promoter. He handed her a card from Chesney that read, as Swift recalls, “I’m sorry that you couldn’t come on the tour, so I wanted to make it up to you.” With the note was a check. “It was for more money than I’d ever seen in my life,” Swift says. “I was able to pay my band bonuses. I was able to pay for my tour buses. I was able to fuel my dreams.”
Listening to Swift share this, on a clear fall afternoon in her New York City apartment, I’m struck by how satisfying the story is. There are high stakes at the outset; there are details, vivid and sensory; there’s a twist that flips the action on its head; and there’s a happy ending for its hero. It takes her only about 30 seconds to recount this, but those 30 seconds contain an entire narrative world.
I’m not surprised. Swift has a preternatural skill for finding the story. Her anecdote about Chesney symbolizes a larger narrative in Swift’s life, one about redemption—where our protagonist discovers new happiness not despite challenges, but because of them. Swift, as we’ll discuss, took a few hits to get here. “I’ve been raised up and down the flagpole of public opinion so many times in the last 20 years,” she says as we tuck into a cozy den off the kitchen to talk, and she kicks off her shoes and curls up onto the sofa. “I’ve been given a tiara, then had it taken away.” She is seemingly unguarded in conversation, reflective about both where she’s been and where she finds herself now. After all, while she’s long been one of the biggest entertainers in the world, this year is different. “It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,” she says. “And for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.” This is her story—even if she’s now so high that it’s hard to believe she was ever low.
Swift’s accomplishments as an artist—culturally, critically, and commercially—are so legion that to recount them seems almost beside the point. As a pop star, she sits in rarefied company, alongside Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna; as a songwriter, she has been compared to Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Joni Mitchell. As a businesswoman, she has built an empire worth, by some estimates, over $1 billion. And as a celebrity—
who by dint of being a woman is scrutinized for everything from whom she dates
 to what she wears—she has long commanded constant attention and knows how to use it. (“I don’t give Taylor advice about being famous,” Stevie Nicks tells me. “She doesn’t need it.”) But this year, something shifted. To discuss her movements felt like discussing politics or the weather—a language spoken so widely it needed no context. She became the main character of the world.
If you’re skeptical, consider it: How many conversations did you have about Taylor Swift this year? How many times did you see a photo of her while scrolling on your phone? Were you one of the people who made a pilgrimage to a city where she played? Did you buy a ticket to her concert film? Did you double-tap an Instagram post, or laugh at a tweet, or click on a headline about her? Did you find yourself humming “Cruel Summer” while waiting in line at the grocery store? Did a friend confess that they watched clips of the 
Eras Tour
 night after night on TikTok? Or did you?
Her epic career-retrospective tour recounting her artistic “eras,” which played 66 dates across the Americas this year, is projected to become the biggest of all time and the first to gross over a billion dollars; analysts talked about the “Taylor effect,” as politicians from Thailand, Hungary, and Chile implored her to play their countries. Cities, stadiums, and streets were renamed for her. Every time she came to a new place, a mini economic boom took place as hotels and restaurants saw a surge of visitors. In releasing her concert movie, Swift bypassed studios and streamers, instead forging an unusual pact with AMC, giving the theater chain its highest single-day ticket sales in history. There are at least 10 college classes devoted to her, including one at Harvard; the professor, Stephanie Burt, tells TIME she plans to compare Swift’s work to that of the poet William Words-worth. Friendship bracelets traded by her fans at concerts became a hot accessory, with one line in a song causing as much as a 500% increase in sales at craft stores. When Swift started dating Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chief and two-time Super Bowl champion, his games saw a massive increase in viewership. (Yes, she somehow made one of America’s most popular things—football—even more popular.) And then there’s her critically hailed songbook—a catalog so beloved that as she rereleases it, she’s often breaking chart records she herself set. She’s the last monoculture left in our stratified world.
It’s hard to see history when you’re in the middle of it, harder still to distinguish Swift’s impact on the culture from her celebrity, which emits so much light it can be blinding. But something unusual is happening with Swift, without a contemporary precedent. She deploys the most efficient medium of the day—the pop song—to tell her story. Yet over time, she has harnessed the power of the media, both traditional and new, to create something wholly unique—a narrative world, in which her music is just one piece in an interactive, shape-shifting story. Swift is that story’s architect and hero, protagonist and narrator.
This was the year she perfected her craft—not just with her music, but in her position as the master storyteller of the modern era. The world, in turn, watched, clicked, cried, danced, sang along, swooned, caravanned to stadiums and movie theaters, let her work soundtrack their lives. For Swift, it’s a peak. “This is the proudest and happiest I’ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I’ve ever been,” Swift tells me. “Ultimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there’s only one question.” Here, she adopts a booming voice. “Are you not entertained?”
A few months before I sit with Swift in New York, on a summer night in Santa Clara, Calif., which has been temporarily renamed Swiftie Clara in her honor, I am in a stadium with nearly 70,000 other people having a religious experience. The crowd is rapturous and Swift beatific as she gazes out at us, all high on the same drug. Her fans are singularly passionate, not just in the venue but also online, as they analyze clues, hints, and secret messages in everything from her choreography to her costumes—some deliberately planted, others not. (“Taylor Swift fans are the modern-day equivalent of those cults who would consistently have inaccurate rapture predictions like once a month,” as one viral tweet noted.)
Standing in the arena, it’s not hard to understand why this is the biggest thing in the world. “Beatlemania and Thriller have nothing on these shows,” says Swift’s friend and collaborator Phoebe Bridgers. Fans in Argentina pitched tents outside the venue for months to get prime spots, with some quitting their jobs to commit to fandom full time. Across the U.S., others lined up for days, while those who didn’t get in “Taylor-gated” in nearby parking lots so they could pick up the sound. When tickets went on sale last year, Ticketmaster crashed. Although 4.1 million tickets were sold for the 2023 shows—including over 2 million on the first day, a new record—scalpers jacked up prices on the secondary market to more than $22,000. Multiple fans filed lawsuits. The Justice Department moved forward with an investigation. The Senate held a hearing. Given these stakes, Swift had to deliver.
“I knew this tour was harder than anything I’d ever done before by a long shot,” Swift says. Each show spans over 180 minutes, including 40-plus songs from at least nine albums; there are 16 costume changes, pyrotechnics, an optical illusion in which she appears to dive into the stage and swim, and not one but two cottagecore worlds, which feature an abundance of moss."

Out of the stillness, soft-spoken words

Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some more weed, funk, you don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day

Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it (

On how to be insensitive

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet"
1996,33,Gangsta's Paradise,Coolio featuring L.V.,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C-
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know

Wisst ihr was?
Ich mag die Playettes
Ohne Zweifel, ohne Zweifel, ah
Mach weiter, Playette
Mach weiter, Playette
Yo, Dre, hau raus
[Strophe 1: Dr. Dre]
Es geht ab, blende zu Blackstreet
Die Homies haben es auf mich abgesehen, Kollaborationskreationen sind wie Akne
Kein Zweifel, ich hab's drauf, ich bin nie nachlässig
Solange mein Kredit bürgt, könnte mich kein Hund schnappen
Sag mir, wer aufhören kann, wenn Dre Moves macht
Die Mädels wie ein Magnet anzieht
Ihnen Ohrgasmen gebe mit meinem sanften Akzent
Ich bewege immer noch diesen Flair
Mit den Kumpels Blackstreet und Teddy
Die echten Rump Shaker
[Strophe 2: Teddy Riley]
Shawty, geht in die Knie, guter Gott
Baby hat die ganze Stadt für sich offen
Strikt im Geschäft, sie spielt nicht herum
Sie deckt viele Gebiete ab, Kundschaft in Massen
Bezahlt zu werden ist ihre Stärke
Jeden einzelnen Tag, wie ein echter Player
Ich kriege sie nicht aus dem Kopf (Wow)
Ich denke die ganze Zeit an das Mädchen (Wow-wow)
Von der Eastside zur Westside
Pusht fette Fahrten, es ist keine Überraschung
Sie hat Tricks im Versteck, stapelt das Geld
Schnell, wenn es um das Benzin geht
Auf keinen Fall durchschnittlich
Sie ist dabei, wenn sie es haben muss

Kann ich einsteigen, damit ich gewinnen kann?"

Was waiting for you
To pull back the door
To take me by the hand

To do all the things your man won't do

Would treat his woman so cold?
Treat you like you're nothing
When you're worth more than gold?
Girl, to me, you're like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred-million-dollar treasure
I'd give the world to make you mine
(La-la-la-la-laaa)

I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand

Nothing is forbidden when we touch"

How could you turn your back on me? Oh, oh

Bring back the joy to my life

1996,91,Po Pimp,Do or Die featuring Twista,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you
[Verse 4]
Sometimes, I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes, you're crazy, then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Dolphins make me cry
[Chorus]
But there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you"
1996,100,Don't Cry,Seal,https://genius.com/Seal-dont-cry-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Don't be so hard on yourself
Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh, my baby
Please, my baby
My baby
[Verse 2]
When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then
And we lived our life without any doubt
Those memories
They seem so long ago
What's become of them?
When you feel like me, I want you to know
[Hook]
Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby"
1997,1,Candle in the Wind 1997,Elton John,https://genius.com/Elton-john-candle-in-the-wind-1997-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years"
1997,2,You Were Meant for Me,Jewel,https://genius.com/Jewel-you-were-meant-for-me-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I hear the clock, it's 6 a.m. 
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
[Chorus]
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
[Verse 2]
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause"

1997,4,Un-Break My Heart,Toni Braxton,https://genius.com/Toni-braxton-un-break-my-heart-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
[Chorus]
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
[Verse 2]
Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me"
1997,5,Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,Puff Daddy featuring Mase,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

[Verse 1]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
[Pre-Chorus]
If I can see it
Then I can do it
If I just believe it
There's nothing to it
[Chorus]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (Woo)

See, I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh"

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion
, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look, then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat"

Ihnen Ohrgasmen gebe mit meinem sanften Akzent

Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders

Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me

But it's all coming back to me

1997,58,Up Jumps da Boogie,Magoo and Timbaland,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

A down ass brother been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for you, I know I can't trust you
Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like a brother no more
I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there"

If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!

Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!"

1997,80,No Time,Lil' Kim featuring Puff Daddy,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Running around, trying everything new

I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world, they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me"

I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, ""This is where I'm meant to be.""
[Chorus]
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
[Verse 2]
Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through
[Chorus]
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
'Til I go the distance and my journey is complete
[Bridge]
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart"

Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid,

Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay (Haha)

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do
[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—
[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)

What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on
[Verse 1: Usher]

Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, ""Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?""
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want (You can get mad if you want to)
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—
[Chorus: Usher]
My way (My way)
My way (Oh, oh)
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way

[Verse 1]
I am thinkin' of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then, my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through
Without you by my side
[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imaginin' I'm lookin' in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet, you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight"

[Verse 1: Monica]
Boy, this evening, was it only me?
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feelin' this way
Especially the thought of gettin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'"

Yo, yo, this Ma$e, you know what I'm saying?
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad 'cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the— those PHD niggas
But you know, I pop a lot of shit, but I back it up, though
See, it's a difference, a lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas
Me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you want to dance, we dance
[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Now, trick, what? Lace who? That ain't what Ma$e do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face, boo, not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny, never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, ""Rewind that""
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Get your ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money, fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay, so I look both ways
Cop say it's okay, my tint smoke gray
No way nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Lamb' and my 6
Niggas out the pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship"

Adia I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone

There's no one left to talk to, honey

Are you sure you're there alone?
'Cause I'm
Trying to explain
Something's wrong
You just don't sound the same
Why don't you, why don't you
Go outside, go outside?
[Chorus]
Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain"

Hear my cries, hear my call
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my error, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss
Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, 
pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap
Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes, come with me
Come with me, yeah
Come with me
Uh-huh, yeah
You said to trust you, you'd never hurt me
Now I'm disgusted, since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me, ridiculed me
Left me hanging, now shit’s boomeranging
Right back at you, think long range
Narrow-minded, left me blinded
I cosigned it, shit backfired
But I'm bouncing back, I grinded
Not many would bear the pressure, you comprehend me?
You want to end me, you offend me
It's drama, feel the trauma
Come with me"

Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying ""Get back together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman

although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me, but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know the vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson & Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad

I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt"

And some trees got me

Cause all these pinhead niggas is tryna pop our balloon

Ordered the fondu that you can dip the bread in
The pilots know my name

1998,59,Lookin' at Me,Mase featuring Puff Daddy,https://genius.com/Billboard-hot-rap-songs-chart-25th-anniversary-top-100-songs-lyrics,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like 
Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

With starlight tonight

I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see through your eyes

Holla if ya hear me girl you know I'm comin' through

Let me wipe away your ghetto tears misery and pain

In-house beach, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko
 
from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I'll knock that boot if you out to get koofed"

Hey, oh
Yeah
[Chorus]
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you""
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine, tell me
[Verse]
How could you be so cold to me?
When I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please?
If you love me, how could you do that to me, tell me
Whoa, hey"

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
[Chorus]
These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
[Verse 2]
You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart, and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you"

I should've seen you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions

We had some problems, but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I opened up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back,
 I'm a sucker for love

Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

Make you and then break you

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here

And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

Birdman: Time changes time. Everything about the game changed from 10 years ago to now. You never had none of the things that we have now, like the Internet. So many different ways for us to make money now in music. And it’s so digital. We’re a digital-driven brand, we’re an Internet brand.
We global nowadays. 15 years ago, when we first jumped on the scene with Universal, we had gotten too big as artists to be independent. But I still look at us as an indie company because we’re self-contained, we’re self owned. We came in the game self-contained, we probably the last independent label that lasted as long as it did. We our own bosses, run our own ship.
For years we did it all off our own money. [The Universal deal] was a risk from day one, but I refuse to let somebody take something that we work hard for and just take half of it. I couldn’t see myself doing that.
What do you see happening in the future of the music business?
It’s gonna keep getting bigger. Music is spreading into all TVs, networks, and sports. It’s gonna keep expanding. There gonna be quicker ways to become a millionaire. People gonna be playing with millions off of music.
It’s more prosperous, we have so much technology. You don’t have to be an artist if you got some different type of technology—you can make money in a lot of different ways.
I’ll also say we’ll be the first billion-dollar brand of music, that’s our goal. We never had a billionaire brand in music, the closest thing we had was Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson sold 750 million records. I think we’re gonna set the tone for other youngsters to make more money and see that a billion dollars can be accomplished.
How many records has Cash Money sold so far?
We sold 150 million so far. Our track record runs deep. We’ve been the most dominant force of 2011, we gonna be the most dominant force of 2012. We have 16 releases in the first six months of this year. Our goal, as a brand, is to put out 100 albums a year. So I’m trying to figure out how we gonna reach that…
100 albums a year?
We gonna do 16 in the first six months and we gonna try this year to try to put out at least 30 this year. Next year, we’ll try to put out 50. We just gonna keep growing. To have 100 active acts is a lot. It ain’t just rappers, it’s different artists in different parts of the country: rap, pop, country, gospel—its everything.

Big orange ball, sinking in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels
[Chorus]
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done
[Verse 2]
Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels"

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
[Pre-Chorus]
I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams
[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you
[Verse 2]
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart"

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
[Chorus]
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me"

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone & 
Thug Queen
]
The name is Krayzie, big bad-ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so there's nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughtta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now I'm watchin' for them damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse ""whoa nellie""
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the law
Jar
 out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job so I told her to ride come on
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you with it
We out before the sunrise
Gotta stallion for ya partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride lets ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups"

Sometimes I feel like I am drunk behind the wheel
The wheel of possibility, however it may roll
Give it a spin, see if you can somehow factor in
You know there's always more than one way
To say exactly what you mean to say
[Chorus]
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?
I was waiting for an indication
It was hard to find
Don't matter what I say, only what I do
I never mean to do bad things to you
So quiet, but I finally woke up
If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too
[Chorus]
Was I out of my head? Was I out of my mind?
How could I have ever been so blind?

So quiet, but I finally woke up
If you're sad, then it's time you spoke up, too

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!

Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier"

I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
